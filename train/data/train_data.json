{"text": "It is done, and submitted. You can play \u201cSurvival of the Tastiest\u201d on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multi-touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot I\u2019d like to talk about. I\u2019ll go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list.\n\nConcept\n\nWorking over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks I had to face.\n\nOriginally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise \u2013 something with lots of enemies/actors, simple graphics, maybe set in space, controlled from a top-down view. I was confident I could fit any theme around it.\n\nIn the end, the problem with a theme like \u201cEvolution\u201d in a game is that evolution is unassisted. It happens through several seemingly random mutations over time, with the most apt permutation surviving. This genetic car simulator is, in my opinion, a great example of actual evolution of a species facing a challenge. But is it a game?\n\nIn a game, you need to control something to reach an objective. That control goes against what evolution is supposed to be like. If you allow the user to pick how to evolve something, it\u2019s not evolution anymore \u2013 it\u2019s the equivalent of intelligent design, the fable invented by creationists to combat the very idea of evolution. Being agnostic and a Pastafarian, that\u2019s not something that rubbed me the right way.\n\nHence, my biggest dillema when deciding what to create was not with what I wanted to create, but with what I did not. I didn\u2019t want to create an \u201cintelligent design\u201d simulator and wrongly call it evolution.\n\nThis is a problem, of course, every other contestant also had to face. And judging by the entries submitted, not many managed to work around it. I\u2019d say the only real solution was through the use of artificial selection, somehow. So far, I haven\u2019t seen any entry using this at its core gameplay.\n\nAlas, this is just a fun competition and after a while I decided not to be as strict with the game idea, and allowed myself to pick whatever I thought would work out.\n\nMy initial idea was to create something where humanity tried to evolve to a next level but had some kind of foe trying to stop them from doing so. I kind of had this image of human souls flying in space towards a monolith or a space baby (all based in 2001: A Space Odyssey of course) but I couldn\u2019t think of compelling (read: serious) mechanics for that.\n\nBorgs were my next inspiration, as their whole hypothesis fit pretty well into the evolution theme. But how to make it work? Are you the borg, or fighting the Borg?\n\nThe third and final idea came to me through my girlfriend, who somehow gave me the idea of making something about the evolution of Pasta. The more I thought about it the more it sounded like it would work, so I decided to go with it.\n\nConversations with my inspiring co-worker Roushey (who also created the \u201cMechanical Underdogs\u201d signature logo for my intros) further matured the concept, as it involved into the idea of having individual pieces of pasta flying around and trying to evolve until they became all-powerful. A secondary idea here was that the game would work to explain how the Flying Spaghetti Monster came to exist \u2013 by evolving from a normal dinner table.\n\nSo the idea evolved more or less into this: you are sitting a table. You have your own plate, with is your \u201cbase\u201d. There are 5 other guests at the table, each with their own plate.\n\nYour plate can spawn little pieces of pasta. You do so by \u201cordering\u201d them through a menu. Some pastas are better than others; some are faster, some are stronger. They have varying costs, which are debited from your credits (you start with a number of credits).\n\nOnce spawned, your pastas start flying around. Their instinct is to fly to other plates, in order to conquer them (the objective of the game is having your pasta conquer all the plates on the table). But they are really autonomous, so after being spawned, you have no control over your pasta (think DotA or LoL creeps).\n\nYour pasta doesn\u2019t like other people\u2019s pasta, so if they meet, they shoot sauce at each other until one dies. You get credits for other pastas your own pasta kill.\n\nOnce a pasta is in the vicinity of a plate, it starts conquering it for its team. It takes around 10 seconds for a plate to be conquered; less if more pasta from the same team are around. If pasta from other team are around, though, they get locked down in their attempt, unable to conquer the plate, until one of them die (think Battlefield\u2019s standard \u201cConquest\u201d mode).\n\nYou get points every second for every plate you own.\n\nOver time, the concept also evolved to use an Italian bistro as its main scenario.\n\nCarlos, Carlos\u2019 Bistro\u2019s founder and owner\n\nSetup\n\nNo major changes were made from my work setup. I used FDT and Starling creating an Adobe AIR (ActionScript) project, all tools or frameworks I already had some knowledge with.\n\nOne big change for me was that I livestreamed my work through a twitch.tv account. This was a new thing for me. As recommended by Roushey, I used a program called XSplit and I got to say, it is pretty amazing. It made the livestream pretty effortless and the features are awesome, even for the free version. It was great to have some of my friends watch me, and then interact with them and random people through chat. It was also good knowing that I was also recording a local version of the files, so I could make a timelapse video later.\n\nKnowing the video was being recorded also made me a lot more self-conscious about my computer use, as if someone was watching over my shoulder. It made me realize that sometimes I spend too much time in seemingly inane tasks (I ended up wasting the longest time just to get some text alignment the way I wanted \u2013 it\u2019ll probably drive someone crazy if they watch it) and that I do way too many typos where writing code. I pretty much spend half of the time writing a line and the other half fixing the crazy characters in it.\n\nMy own stream was probably boring to watch since I was coding for the most time. But livestreaming is one of the cool things to do as a spectator too. It was great seeing other people working \u2013 I had a few tabs opened on my second monitor all the time. It\u2019s actually a bit sad, because if I could, I could have spent the whole weekend just watching other people working! But I had to do my own work, so I\u2019d only do it once in a while, when resting for a bit.\n\nDesign\n\nAlthough I wanted some simple, low-fi, high-contrast kind of design, I ended up going with somewhat realistic (vector) art. I think it worked very well, fitting the mood of the game, but I also went overboard.\n\nFor example: to know the state of a plate (who owns it, who\u2019s conquering it and how much time they have left before conquering it, which pasta units are in the queue, etc), you have to look at the plate\u2019s bill.\n\nThe problem I realized when doing some tests is that people never look at the bill! They think it\u2019s some kind of prop, so they never actually read its details.\n\nPlus, if you\u2019re zoomed out too much, you can\u2019t actually read it, so it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s going on with the game until you zoom in to the area of a specific plate.\n\nOne other solution that didn\u2019t turn out to be as perfect as I thought was how to indicate who a plate base belongs to. In the game, that\u2019s indicated by the plate\u2019s decoration \u2013 its color denotes the team owner. But it\u2019s something that fits so well into the design that people never realized it, until they were told about it.\n\nIn the end, the idea of going with a full physical metaphor is one that should be done with care. Things that are very important risk becoming background noise, unless the player knows its importance.\n\nOriginally, I wanted to avoid any kind of heads-up display in my game. In the end, I ended up adding it at the bottom to indicate your credits and bases owned, as well as the hideous out-of-place-and-still-not-obvious \u201cCall Waiter\u201d button. But in hindsight, I should have gone with a simple HUD from the start, especially one that indicated each team\u2019s colors and general state of the game without the need for zooming in and out.\n\nDevelopment\n\nDevelopment went fast. But not fast enough.\n\nEven though I worked around 32+ hours for this Ludum Dare, the biggest problem I had to face in the end was overscoping. I had too much planned, and couldn\u2019t get it all done.\n\nContent-wise, I had several kinds of pasta planned (Wikipedia is just amazing in that regard), split into several different groups, from small Pastina to huge Pasta al forno. But because of time constraints, I ended up scratching most of them, and ended up with 5 different types of very small pasta \u2013 barely something to start when talking about the evolution of Pasta.\n\nPastas used in the game. Unfortunately, the macs where never used\n\nWhich is one of the saddest things about the project, really. It had the framework and the features to allow an endless number of elements in there, but I just didn\u2019t have time to draw the rest of the assets needed (something I loved to do, by the way).\n\nOther non-obvious features had to be dropped, too. For example, when ordering some pasta, you were supposed to select what kind of sauce you\u2019d like with your pasta, each with different attributes. Bolognese, for example, is very strong, but inaccurate; Pesto is very accurate and has great range, but it\u2019s weaker; and my favorite, Vodka, would triggers 10% loss of speed on the pasta hit by it.\n\nThe code for that is mostly in there. But in the end, I didn\u2019t have time to implement the sauce selection interface; all pasta ended up using bolognese sauce.\n\nTo-do list: lots of things were not done\n\nActual programming also took a toll in the development time. Having been programming for a while, I like to believe I got to a point where I know how to make things right, but at the expense of forgetting how to do things wrong in a seemingly good way. What I mean is that I had to take a lot of shortcuts in my code to save time (e.g. a lot of singletons references for cross-communication rather than events or observers, all-encompassing check loops, not fast enough) that left a very sour taste in my mouth. While I know I used to do those a few years ago and survive, I almost cannot accept the state my code is in right now.\n\nAt the same time, I do know it was the right thing to do given the timeframe.\n\nOne small thing that had some impact was using a somewhat new platform for me. That\u2019s Starling, the accelerated graphics framework I used in Flash. I had tested it before and I knew how to use it well \u2013 the API is very similar to Flash itself. However, there were some small details that had some impact during development, making me feel somewhat uneasy the whole time I was writing the game. It was, again, the right thing to do, but I should have used Starling more deeply before (which is the conundrum: I used it for Ludum Dare just so I could learn more about it).\n\nArgument and user experience\n\nOne final aspect of the game that I learned is that making the game obvious for your players goes a long way into making it fun. If you have to spend the longest time explaining things, your game is doing something wrong.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly the problem Survival of the Tastiest ultimately faced. It\u2019s very hard for people to understand what\u2019s going on with the game, why, and how. I did have some introductory text at the beginning, but that was a last-minute thing. More importantly, I should have had a better interface or simplified the whole concept so it would be easier for people to understand.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the game itself should be simple. It just means that the experience and interface should be approachable and understandable.\n\nConclusion\n\nI\u2019m extremely happy with what I\u2019ve done and, especially given that this was my first Ludum Dare. However, I feel like I\u2019ve learned a lot of what not to do.\n\nThe biggest problem is overscoping. Like Eric Decker said, the biggest lesson we can learn with this is probably with scoping \u2013 deciding what to do beforehand in a way you can complete it without having to rush and do something half-assed.\n\nI\u2019m sure I will do more Ludum Dares in the future. But if there are any lessons I can take of it, they are to make it simple, to use frameworks and platforms you already have some absolute experience with (otherwise you\u2019ll spend too much time trying to solve easy questions), and to scope for a game that you can complete in one day only (that way, you can actually take two days and make it cool).\n\nThis entry was posted\non Monday, August 27th, 2012 at 10:54 am and is filed under LD #24.\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\nYou can skip to the end and leave a response.

(assuming the ban was for something rather unforgivable, 20 years is a long time?) \nThey both could have been in the Order by then, but unlikely given Aberforth's attitude in Deathly Hallows once the trio arrive in Hogsmeade looking for the tiara.  We learn now that a lot of trafficking goes on through the Hogs Head so maybe Dung was trading with Aberforth, Sirius' mirror and various other Black artifacts, he just was not allowed in the pub. \nAnyone with something in canon or more plausible?\n\nA:\n\nwhy was he banned?\nI'm not able to find any canon data on that, either book text search or interviews transcripts.\n\nhow is it that he is then speaking to Aberforth in Halfblood Prince?\nIn HBP, he's speaking to Aberforth, NOT being inside Hog's Head.

{"text": "Working Women, Special Provision and the Debate on Equality\n\nThere has been considerable coverage in the media recently about the possibility of offering women in employment paid leave from work during their menstrual period. This has generated a broad range of responses relating to long-standing discussions about \u2018equality\u2019 and \u2018difference\u2019: is women\u2019s equality best achieved by treating them the same as men or by making provisions that recognise their differences in terms of physiological constitution and biological functions?\n\nIf the UK introduces such an initiative, it would not be the first country in the contemporary world to do so. Many countries in Asia already make the provision and Russia debated introducing a law in 2013. The policy also has a significant historical precedent. A whole chapter of my book Women Workers in the Soviet Interwar Economy: From \u2018Protection\u2019 to \u2018Equality\u2019 (Macmillan, 1999), based on extensive research conducted for my PhD, is devoted to \u2018Provision for \u201cMenstrual Leave\u201d\u2019.\n\nIn the 1920s, scientific researchers and labour hygiene specialists in the Soviet Union conducted extensive investigations into the impact of menstruation on women\u2019s capacity to work in manual and industrial jobs requiring a significant degree of physical labour. Their recommendations led to two decrees being issued that targeted specific categories of women workers:\n\nDecree \u2018On the release from work during menstruation of machinists and iron press workers working on cutting machines without mechanised gears in the garment industry\u2019, 11 January 1922\n\nDecree \u2018On the working conditions of women tractor and lorry drivers\u2019, 9 May 1931\n\nThese decrees arose from research that suggested, amongst other things, that inadequate seating at machines and on tractors resulted in congestion and tension in the abdomen that was exacerbated during menstruation. In practice, the decrees did not provide for regular absence from work. Women seeking to benefit from the provision had to provide a doctor\u2019s note, similar to the usual requirements for sick leave.\n\nThe official research into the impact of menstruation on women\u2019s capacity to work and the application of the decrees in practice raised a number of issues on both sides of the argument. I offer only a summary of the contemporary research findings and observer commentary here:\n\nFor the provision:\n\u2022 employers have a responsibility to protect the health of their workers and unhealthy, poor and inadequate working environments can have a detrimental impact on women\u2019s reproductive health\n\u2022 women\u2019s labour productivity and output would rise as a result\n\u2022 it is essential to protect the professionalism of certain categories of workers: the debates here centred on performance artists and female theatrical employees engaged in highly physical and intensely emotional work\n\u2022 heavy physical labour and strenuous exercise can lead to disruptions of the menstrual cycle\n\u2022 women\u2019s physical and intellectual capacities are reduced during menstruation; women lose muscular strength and powers of concentration\n\u2022 women\u2019s biological constitution and reproductive functions require specific recognition in law\n\nAgainst the provision:\n\u2022 employers are less likely to appoint women if they are guaranteed paid time off work during menstruation\n\u2022 (often from male workers, who viewed the employment of women as competition) women should not be employed in jobs for which they lack the physical strength and mental capacity\n\u2022 if necessary, women could be transferred to different tasks involving easier work during menstruation\n\u2022 the provision would be open to uneven application and abuse\n\u2022 women cannot expect to be considered equal with men if they are given special treatment in the law\n\nIt is worth noting also that the various research projects often revealed that the vast majority of women reported no regular problems or abnormalities with menstruation, and that men commonly reported higher levels of sickness than their female colleagues. Many of the problems experienced by women in the workplace could be mitigated by the introduction of improvements to their physical working conditions (not sitting down or standing up in the same position for long periods of time) or by the simple introduction of very short breaks that would allow women to walk around and get some exercise.\n\nDebates in the UK, on the TV and in the press, are unlikely to reach a consensus on this issue.

{"text": "PCI Alternative Using Sustained Exercise (PAUSE): Rationale and trial design.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) currently claims nearly one million lives yearly in the US, accounting for nearly 40% of all deaths. Coronary artery disease (CAD) accounts for the largest number of these deaths. While efforts aimed at treating CAD in recent decades have concentrated on surgical and catheter-based interventions, limited resources have been directed toward prevention and rehabilitation. CAD is commonly treated using percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and this treatment has increased exponentially since its adoption over three decades ago. Recent questions have been raised regarding the cost-effectiveness of PCI, the extent to which PCI is overused, and whether selected patients may benefit from optimal medical therapy in lieu of PCI. One alternative therapy that has been shown to improve outcomes in CAD is exercise therapy; exercise programs have been shown to have numerous physiological benefits, and a growing number of studies have demonstrated reductions in mortality. Given the high volume of PCI, its high cost, its lack of effect on survival and the potential for alternative treatments including exercise, the current study is termed \"PCI Alternative Using Sustained Exercise\" (PAUSE). The primary aim of PAUSE is to determine whether patients randomized to exercise and lifestyle intervention have greater improvement in coronary function and anatomy compared to those randomized to PCI. Coronary function and anatomy is determined using positron emission tomography combined with computed tomographic angiography (PET/CTA). Our objective is to demonstrate the utility of a non-invasive technology to document the efficacy of exercise as an alternative treatment strategy to PCI.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "PubMed Abstracts"}}

Most absorbent articles include an absorbent pad formed by an absorbent core contained in a wrap comprising a barrier tissue and/or a forming tissue. The subject invention discloses an absorbent article generally having extensibility in at least one direction, preferably the cross-direction. Such extensibility permits an absorbent article to extend and expand about the wearer and thus to better conform to the body of the wearer. Such extension and expansion about the wearer is feasible because both the bodyside liner and the outer cover are extensible in at least the one direction.\nIn conventional structures, the outer cover is typically adhesively secured to the forming tissue of the absorbent pad. In such embodiments, extending the outer cover in the cross-direction extends the forming tissue in the cross-direction. The force used to extend the outer cover, and thence the absorbent pad, can tear or otherwise damage the forming tissue or the barrier tissue of the absorbent pad.

I was wondering whether jOOQ might be an interesting tool for discussion on your website, even if it is not exactly an ORM in the classic meaning (as in mapping objects to the relational world > ORM). Instead, jOOQ uses a reverse engineering paradigm (as in mapping relational entities to objects > \"ROM\").\n\nRe: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\n\nObject Role Modeling (the original ORM) is not the same thing as Object/Relational Mapping.\n\nObject/Relational Mapping is still kind-of relevant and interesting to us, since Object Role Modeling is used to design databases (which then will require programmatic access). But there are probably better places to discuss it :]\n\nYour query DSL looks rather like some of the DSLs available for Ruby, such as through the Sequel gem, or Arel. Interesting to see how well that can work with a statically-types language like Java. Maybe you or I should make a generator for ActiveFacts which generates your DSL from CQL queries?\n\nRe: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\n\nSorry for my late reply. Apparently I had not really understood the ideas behind your foundation when I wrote my original post. I understand now, that you are concerned with broader concepts than the \"common ORM\". I actually came across your group because of your linking to ORM Lite (where ORM does stand for Object/Relational Mapping, correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nYes, I have seen some examples for Ruby's Sequel. I personally find statically-typed languages much better for DSL's as the syntax can be formally defined and checked by a compiler - with the limitations an OO language imposes, of course.\n\nSo if I understand this correctly now, \"Object Role Modeling\" and CQL are actually a more general way of expressing what SQL calls DDL. Since you can already transform CQL into SQL DDL statements (CREATE TABLE...), and jOOQ can reverse-engineer database schemata into jOOQ generated source code, I don't think there would be need for an additional generator.\n\nDoes CQL also specify means of querying the data described by the Object Role Model? The examples I found here only seem to describe what SQL calls \"constraints\" (although with a much broader functionality-range than SQL):\n\nRe: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\n\n\"common ORM\". I actually came across your group because of your linking to ORM Lite (where ORM does stand for Object/Relational Mapping\n\nObject Role Modeling was named before Object Relational Mapping, but the latter is now the more common meaning, as you point out. But ORM Lite is actually so-named by Bryan because it is an implementation of Object Role Modeling, not because it is also an O/RM. Bryan was a student of Terry's at Neumont, where he learnt ORM.\n\nRegarding DSLs, I think internal DSLs only work well in very simple cases. I prefer external DSLs for anything complex, and that's where CQL came from. Even the extremely flexible syntax of Ruby wasn't up to the task.\n\nlukas.eder:\n\nI don't think there would be need for an additional generator\n\nThe problem is that a huge amount of meaning is lost in the mapping to SQL. SQL is practically (though not theoretically) limited to representing physical models. These are almost always very different from the conceptual model, as many relationships have been condensed (absorbed) into attribute/column relationships, so the semantics of the original relationship are lost. In the process, nullable columns are usually introduced, which adds further to the confusion, as such things cannot easily be correctly constrained (uniqueness, etc) in SQL. So by reverse engineering from the relational form, you're losing most of the benefit of building a conceptual model from the start\n\nThis may be hard to see for someone used to O-O modeling, and who's authored an O/RM tool. The problem is that O-O suffers from many of the same problems of loss of semantics. The apparently clear notion of \"attribute\" breaks down when you look at it closely. O-O, although ostensibly behaviour-oriented, introduces attributes to store state, and this attribute orientation is the source of the problem in both cases. Fact-oriented model does not use attributes. Although it may seem obvious that, for example, my surname is an attribute of myself, if the system being modeled accrues the requirement to model families, suddenly surname becomes an attribute of family, and family becomes my attribute. This kind of instability is responsible for much of the rework that's required in evolving legacy systems, as well as many of the mistakes made when they were first modeled. If you want a further example of this loss of semantics, look at my Insurance example, and ask yourself why the VehicleIncident table has a DrivingBloodTestResult column. In fact, if VehicleIncident wasn't explicitly mapped separately, its fields would be in the Claim table.\n\nWhat's needed is not just yet another O/RM tool (which are tuppence a dozen anyhow - I personally have written three) but a tool which supports database programming using only the conceptual model, never exposing the physical model. Surprisingly, I can't think of a single tool which has done a good job of this, but it's where I'm heading with the ActiveFacts API. It's another O/RM, but using a purely conceptual object model that preserves the domain semantics, not a typical O-O one.\n\nlukas.eder:\n\nDoes CQL also specify means of querying the data described by the Object Role Model\n\nYes, though the published implementation doesn't quite handle the full query syntax (aggregate functions are still missing), nor does it yet translate them to SQL. Some examples are given towards the end of the video presentation on the CQL Introduction page.\n\nRe: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?\n\nRegarding DSLs, I think internal DSLs only work well in very simple cases. I prefer external DSLs for anything complex, and that's where CQL came from. Even the extremely flexible syntax of Ruby wasn't up to the task.\n\nAbsolutely. The optimal way to implement SQL in Java would be by extending the Java language itself, such that SQL would be compiled natively by the java compiler, similar to Linq2SQL in C#, or PL/SQL in Oracle databases. So for the complexity of CQL, CQL is certainly the right solution.\n\nClifford Heath:\n\nThe problem is that a huge amount of meaning is lost in the mapping to SQL. SQL is practically (though not theoretically) limited to representing physical models.\n\nYou are right. I guess though, that in everyday work, this limitation is not really a problem. Personally, I think if your business rules become so complex that you cannot map them to a relational model easily anymore, then maybe your business rules could be simplified before changing/extending technologies. But that depends on the business, of course. I guess with insurance companies' businesses, I'd be pretty lost, personally ;-)\n\nIn any case, I don't see jOOQ as a means to solve modelling issues, or the O/R impedance mismatch (which is even bigger when it comes to mapping your understanding of ORM, with CQL). jOOQ should simply make using the full power of SQL in Java as simple as possible. In that way, jOOQ is not really an ORM because it does not map from objects to the relational world, or try to solve any other high-level abstraction issues. It's really a low-level tool to make a developer's life a lot easier, seeing that unfortunately, JPA CriteriaQuery didn't meet the community's expectations.\n\nClifford Heath:\n\nWhat's needed is not just yet another O/RM tool (which are tuppence a dozen anyhow - I personally have written three) but a tool which supports database programming using only the conceptual model, never exposing the physical model.

I hope for you, that this will soon show nice results with a practical implementation. I'm curious to see how you'll tackle performance issues, too, with all the abstraction.

The decision of whether or not to insert this beam-splitter can be made after the photon has entered the interferometer, as in Wheeler\u2019s famous delayed-choice thought experiment. In recent quantum versions of this experiment, this decision is controlled by a quantum ancilla, while the beam splitter is itself still a classical object.\n\nand the no-cloning theorem is about pure states..\nBut an ensemble of particles in a neuron would make it a mixed state..\n\nThe no-cloning theorem is normally stated and proven for pure states; the no-broadcast theorem generalizes this result to mixed states.\n\nAnd thats why PHASE works for quantum metrology and its ability to harness non classical states\n\nApparently, worrying about measuring both position and momentum works differently for particles than it does waves.\n\nIt may actually be possible using phase.\n\nQuote:\n\nNiels Bohr apparently conceived of the principle of complementarity during a skiing vacation in Norway in February and March 1927, during which he received a letter from Werner Heisenberg regarding the latter's newly discovered (and not yet published) uncertainty principle. Upon returning from his vacation, by which time Heisenberg had already submitted his paper on the uncertainty principle for publication, he convinced Heisenberg that the uncertainty principle was a manifestation of the deeper concept of complementarity.[6] Heisenberg duly appended a note to this effect to his paper on the uncertainty principle, before its publication, stating:\n\nQuote:\n\nBohr has brought to my attention [that] the uncertainty in our observation does not arise exclusively from the occurrence of discontinuities, but is tied directly to the demand that we ascribe equal validity to the quite different experiments which show up in the [particulate] theory on one hand, and in the wave theory on the other hand.\n\nAnd \"quadratures\" is about position and momentum..\nWhich are apparently always orthogonal to each other.\n\nThere is obviously something to all of this.\nCounterfactual Communication was recently used to transmit information without sending any PARTICLES.\nthe information was sent in the phase.. of a wavefunction?\n\nand it used MachZenhder Interferometry..\nwhich is part of Quantum Metrology and its ability to harness non-classical states..\n\nand all of this can teleport non-classical light..\n\nand it all uses ANCILLAS... which store VALUES, and WAVEFUNCTIONS.. because they are Qubits/ Nitrogen vacancies..\n\nand are used in WEAK MEASUREMENT... which was used to measure a wavefunction.. something most would argue is impossible.. because of the uncertainty principle..\n\nQuote:\n\nAn interpretation of quantum mechanics can be said to involve the use of counterfactual definiteness if it includes in the statistical population of measurement results, any measurements that are counterfactual because they are excluded by the quantum mechanical impossibility of simultaneous measurement of conjugate pairs of properties.\n\nFor example, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that one cannot simultaneously know, with arbitrarily high precision, both the position and momentum of a particle\n\nQuote:\n\nThe word \"counterfactual\" does not mean \"characterized by being opposed to fact.\" Instead, it characterizes values that could have been measured but, for one reason or another, were not\n\nand its the Ancillas that store values.. and may or may not be part of the measurement apparatus... / interferometer..\n\nIn 2015, Counterfactual Quantum Computation was demonstrated in the experimental context of \"spins of a negatively charged Nitrogen-vacancy color center in a diamond\".[5] Previously suspected limits of efficiency were exceeded, achieving counterfactual computational efficiency of 85% with the higher efficiency foreseen in principle\n\nQuote:\n\nThe quantum computer may be physically implemented in arbitrary ways but the common apparatus considered to date features a Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer. The quantum computer is set in a superposition of \"not running\" and \"running\" states by means such as the Quantum Zeno Effect. Those state histories are quantum interfered. After many repetitions of very rapid projective measurements, the \"not running\" state evolves to a final value imprinted into the properties of the quantum computer. Measuring that value allows for learning the result of some types of computations such as Grover's algorithm even though the result was derived from the non-running state of the quantum computer.\n\nNV CENTERS can also be used asQUANTUM SPIN PROBES, QUBITS & AS, ANCILLAS\n\nin devices such as\nBIOMEMs scanners\nQUANTUM REPEATERS\nPHOTONIC NETWORKING\n\nand..\n\nMEMRISTORS.. where the vacancies are used for switching between inhibited and excited states, thus simulating NEURONS\n\nMEMRISTORS utilize wavefunctions.\n\nWavefunctions can be weakly measured by ANCILLAS\n\nANCILLAS hold \"values\" ie : wavefunctions\n\nand have GROUND STATES\n\nwhich measured particles are \"cooled\" into for measurement techniques. a literal form of \"photon counting\"..\n\n\"This de-excitation is called \u2018fluorescence\u2019, and it is characterized by a\nlifetime of a few nanoseconds of the lowest vibrational level of the first excited state.\nDe-excitation from the excited singlet state to the ground state also occurs by other mechanisms, such as non-radiant thermal decay or \u2018phosphorescence\u2019. In the latter case, the chromophore undergoes a forbidden transition from the excited singlet state into the triplet state (intersystem crossing, ISC, Fig 2.4), which has a non-zero probability, for example because of spin orbit coupling of the electrons\u2019 magnetic moments\"\n\nits a type of INTERSYSTEM CROSSING\n\ndoing a search for Intersystem crossing, memristor brings up this link..\n\nA composite optical microcavity, in which nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in a diamond nanopillar are coupled to whispering gallery modes in a silica microsphere, is demonstrated. Nanopillars with a diameter as small as 200 nm are fabricated from a bulk diamond crystal by reactive ion etching and are positioned with nanometer precision near the equator of a silica microsphere. The composite nanopillar-microsphere system overcomes the poor controllability of a nanocrystal-based microcavity system and takes full advantage of the exceptional spin properties of NV centers and the ultrahigh quality factor of silica microspheres.\n\nWe investigate the construction of two universal three-qubit quantum gates in a hybrid system. The designed system consists of a flying photon and a stationary negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center fixed on the periphery of a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microresonator, with the WGM cavity coupled to tapered fibers functioning as an add-drop structure. These gate operations are accomplished by encoding the information both on the spin degree of freedom of the electron confined in the NV center and on the polarization and spatial-mode states of the flying photon, respectively\n\nNow Somewhere in this is evidence of a memristor holding a wavefunction\n\nThe shown SPICE implementation (macro model) for a\ncharge controlled memristor model exactly reproduces the\nresults from [2]. However, these simulation results do not\nhave a good compliance - not even qualitatively - with the\ncharacteristic form of I/V curves of manufactured devices.\nTherefore the following equations (3) to (9) try to approach\nmemristor modeling from a different point of view to get a\ncloser match to the measured curves from [2],[6],[7],[8],[10]\nor [11] even with a simple linear drift of w.\nBesides the charge steering mechanism of a memristor modelled in [2],\n[1] also defined a functional relationship for a memristor\nwhich explains the memristive behavior in dependence on its\nmagnetic flux: i(t) = W \u03c6(t) \u00b7 v(t) . (3)\n\nVariable W (\u03c6) represents the memductance which is the\nreciprocal of memristance M. Here a mechanism is demanded\nthat maps the magnetic flux as the input signal to the current\nthat is flowing through the memristor. The magnetic flux \u03c6\nis the integral of voltage v(t) over time: \u03c6 = R v(t) dt.\nWe can assume that an external voltage which is applied to\nthe previously described two-layer structure has an influence\non the movable 2+-dopants over time. The width w(t) of\nthe semiconductor layer is depending on the velocity of the\ndopants vD(t) via the time integral:\nw(t) = w0 + Z0t vD(\u03c4)d\u03c4 . (4)\n\nThe drift velocity vD in an electric field E is defined via its\nmobility \u00b5D: vD(t) = \u00b5D \u00b7 E(t) (5) and the electric field E is connected with the voltage via E(t) = v(t)\nD(6)with D denoting the total thickness of the two-layer structure\n(D = tOX + tSEMI). Due the good conductance of the\nsemiconductor layer the electric field is applied to the time\ndepending thickness of the insulator layer tOX for the most\npart (due to v(l) = R E dl). However, this was neglected for\nreasons of simplification. If we combine (4), (5) and (6), we\nobtain: n(t) = w0 + \u00b5DD\u00b7 Z0t v(\u03c4)d\u03c4 = w0 + \u00b5DD \u00b7 \u03c6(t) . (7)\n\nThis equation shows a proportional dependence of the width w\nfrom the magnetic flux \u03c6. Since the thickness of the insulator\nlayer is in the low nanometer region a tunnel current or\nequivalent mechanism is possible. The magnetic flux slightly\ndecreases the thickness of the insulator layer wich is the barrierfor the tunnel current.This current rises exponentially with a\nreduction of the width tOX(\u03c6) (the exponential dependenceis deducible from the quantum mechanic wave function)\n\nwhich must become the GROUND STATE of the ANCILLA upon non-classical correlation..\n\nbecause a wavefunction is essentially the \"master equation\" (which describe wave equations)\n\nWe investigate theoretically how the spectroscopy of an ancillary qubit can probe cavity (circuit) QED ground states containing photons. We consider three classes of systems (Dicke, Tavis-Cummings and Hopfield-like models), where non-trivial vacua are the result of ultrastrong coupling between N two-level systems and a single-mode bosonic field. An ancillary qubit detuned with respect to the boson frequency is shown to reveal distinct spectral signatures depending on the type of vacua. In particular, the Lamb shift of the ancilla is sensitive to both ground state photon population and correlations. Back-action of the ancilla on the cavity ground state is investigated, taking into account the dissipation via a consistent master equation for the ultrastrong coupling regime. The conditions for high-fidelity measurements are determined.\n\n\\\\\n\nNotice BACK-ACTION, which goes right back to DARPAs Nanodiamond Biosensors and their ability to overcome the standard quantum limit, because of the known/ prepared states in the ancillas/NITROGEN VACANCIES\n\nQuote:\n\n(Quantum) back action refers (in the regime of Quantum systems) to the effect of a detector on the measurement itself, as if the detector is not just making the measurement but also affecting the measured or observed system under a perturbing effect.\nBack action has important consequences on the measurement process and is a significant factor in measurements near the quantum limit, such as measurements approaching the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL).\nBack action is an actively sought-after area of interest in present times. There have been experiments in recent times, with nanomechanical systems, where back action was evaded in making measurements, such as in the following paper :\n\nWhen performing continuous measurements of position with sensitivity approaching quantum mechanical limits, one must confront the fundamental effects of detector back-action.Back-action forces are responsible for the ultimate limit on continuous position detection, can also be harnessed to cool the observed structure[1,2,3,4], and are expected to generate quantum entanglement.\nBack-action can also be evaded, allowing measurements with sensitivities that exceed the standard quantum limit, and potentially allowing for the generation of quantum\nsqueezed states.\n\nSo the NV centers are used as ancillas in the measurement process.. which weakly measure wavefunctions of particles in neurons, most likely singlet and triplet states occurring in ATP and phosphase...\n\nthen those same wavefunctions are transfered and produce a correlation at the ground state..\n\nwhere the ancilla takes on the new value/wavefunction.. and here we find all these ideas..\nminus the switching which I can explain\nMemristors use NV centers to switch between inhibited and excited states\nsinglet and triplet states\nthus producing/simulating/ EMULATING, living neurons and action potentials\n\nand it may just BE the network and its computing speed, that even allows the wavefunction to be \"found\"\n\nArtificial Neural Network.

We hope these novel measurement tools can provide new capabilities to the broader scientific and operational communities,\u201d said Jamil Abo-Shaeer, DARPA program manager. \u201cThe work these teams are doing to apply quantum-assisted measurement to biological imaging could benefit DoD\u2019s efforts to develop specialized drugs and therapies, and potentially support DARPA\u2019s work to better understand how the human brain functions.\u201d\n\n\"Nuclear spin imaging at the atomic level is essential for the under-standing of fundamental biological phenomena and for applicationssuch as drug discovery. The advent of novel nano-scale sensors hasgiven hope of achieving the long-standing goal of single-protein, highspatial-resolution structure determination in their natural environ-ment and ambient conditions. In particular, quantum sensors basedon the spin-dependent photoluminescence of Nitrogen Vacancy (NV)centers in diamond have recently been used to detect nanoscale en-sembles of external nuclear spins. While NV sensitivity is approachingsingle-spin levels, extracting relevant information from a very com-plex structure is a further challenge, since it requires not only theability to sense the magnetic field of an isolated nuclear spin, butalso to achieve atomic-scale spatial resolution. Here we propose amethod that, by exploiting the coupling of the NV center to an intrin-sic quantum memory associated with the Nitrogen nuclear spin, canreach a tenfold improvement in spatial resolution, down to atomic\nscales.\"\n\nSo what its all doing essentially, is mapping the phase of atoms/SINGLETS in ATP, onto a NV center based CCD\n\nand at the singlet level, correlations occur.. creating entanglement\n\nso the particles in the neuron are being correlated with the ancillas, the nitrogen vacancies, where they take on the \"target\" state..\n\nnot only is the above imaging done to obtain a correlation to living neurons, via the singlet states within, but once the connection is established, the MEMRISTOR NETWORK itself can be used to RECONSTRUCT VISION IN REAL TIME\n\nNow add the above method, a direct connection using correlated states shared from neurons TO Memristors... and imagine the reconstruction aided by the AI within the memristor network, as it works on so.. (note, this example is done MERELY using fMRI information)\nnow Imagine statistical ensembles being observed in real time via non-classical entanglement\n\nBut what I'm trying to show, is hows its this assumed entanglement based BCI technology, plus the memristor network it is coupled to, that is responsible for the TI communities complaints that \"they (the government) can see through my own eyes\"\n\nThe nitrogen vacancies in the scanners hold values, wavefunctions, which are prepared states aka Ancilla bits, and are the time domain/reference frequency, which carrries the \"quantum event/wavefunction\" which causes the singlet pairs to form up in the scanned biology..\nand correlates with them at the ground state as the relaxation occurs..\n\nQuote:\n\nIt is important to realize that particles in singlet states need not be locally bound to each other. For example, when the spin states of two electrons are correlated by their emission from a single quantum event that conserves angular momentum, the resulting electrons remain in a shared singlet state even as their separation in space increases indefinitely over time, provided only that their angular momentum states remain unperturbed\n\nand that weakly measured value, the wavefunction is sent through the optical cavity, teleported to identical nitrogen vacancies in memristors.. so the ground states in both system are correlated and thus the neural activity can be monitored in real time in the memristors", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Pile-CC"}}

For formulation, the conservative potassium sorbate was added to the biosurfactant with or without prior heat treatment at 80 \u00b0C for 30 min. After formulation, the biosurfactant samples were stored at room temperature for 180 days and the tensioactive properties of the biomolecule were determined with different pH values, temperatures and concentrations of salt. Then, a central composite rotatable design was used to evaluate the influence of the independent variables (effluent flow rate and formulated biosurfactant flow rate) on the oil removal efficiency in the DAF prototype. The formulated biosurfactant demonstrated good stability in both conservation methods, with tolerance to a wide pH range, salinity and high temperatures, enabling its use in environments with extreme conditions. The efficiency of the formulated biomolecule through heating and addition of sorbate was demonstrated by the 92% oil removal rate in the DAF prototype. The findings demonstrate that the biosurfactant from Bacillus methylotrophicus enhances the efficiency of the DAF process, making this technology cleaner.

{"text": "During my pregnancy, I tried to gather as much information on how painful labor might actually be. I would often hear \u201cmine was horrible, but everyone\u2019s pregnancy is different\u201d or \u201cit was the worst pain I\u2019ve ever felt in my life!\u201d\n\nI heard many horror stories which often ended with, \u201cwell, don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll forget about the pain as soon as your child is born.\u201d Not the most reassuring for a first-time mother, but something I definitely kept in mind the entire time.\n\nI had feared the unknown, but on the other hand, I knew there was no turning back and that my baby was coming one way or another!\n\nTwo weeks before my due date, I noticed some blood. My water didn\u2019t break and I saw no mucous plug, but it seemed that something was happening earlier than expected. Soon after, at 1 a.m. I woke up from a notably different type of cramping. It began to occur every 5 minutes. It wasn\u2019t that painful (yet), but uncomfortable. I felt as if I had to go diarrhea every five minutes. If this is labor, I could handle it for sure I thought, but I knew this was only the beginning.\n\nMy husband nervously drove us to the hospital as if the baby would pop out any second. I had to remind him to not worry. Things usually didn\u2019t happen that fast for first-time moms (or at least I hoped it wouldn\u2019t). I had to go by instinct although in the back of my mind, I wasn\u2019t sure what would happen next.\n\nWe finally got to the birthing center after an hour of driving and the nurses confirmed I wasn\u2019t even dilated. I couldn\u2019t believe it. We were turned away and had to find a hotel because returning home wasn\u2019t an option. It would take two hours just to return again!\n\nThe diarrhea-like cramps were painful and uncomfortable; I couldn\u2019t sleep. I was bleeding slightly and started to actually have these cramps and stomach aches over a 10 hour period. I started googling my symptoms (never a good thing!) and discovered there are people who have this uncomfortable feeling for days and weeks! \u201cFake labor\u201d would not be in my cards, I had hoped.\n\nFortunately, I had an appointment with a midwife in the afternoon and was checked again for any cervical changes. I had finally dilated 3 cm and was 90% effaced. What a relief I thought! I welcomed the pain because I wanted things to progress. I couldn\u2019t imagine having diarrhea cramps for weeks. However, 3 cm isn\u2019t enough to be admitted, we were told, so back to the hotel we went.\n\n\u201cWhen your cramps become more regular, every 3 minutes a part, and you become more snippy, check in again\u201d the midwife suggested. In the mean time, I tried to walk around, pausing multiple times to catch my breath.\n\nA couple hours later, I was FINALLY admitted. My husband kept asking me questions non-stop about what I wanted, needed, and more. All I could say was \u201cif I need something, I\u2019ll let you know. Thanks.\u201d I literally couldn\u2019t talk. I felt like vomiting and had heart burn for the first time in my life.\n\nAs my labor progressed, I felt the urge to push before I was even 10 cm dilated. I would have a cramp, then a couple of minutes later, one that made me yell out in pain as it forced my body to push. A gush of blood would come out as this happened and I felt extremely uncomfortable because the pain was in my back and butt! It would take my breath away. However, the pain was still tolerable, believe it or not.\n\nI had a volunteer doula come in that night who helped me breathe, rubbed my back, and encouraged me. She helped me be aware of my voice and how I could use it to save energy and get through the pain. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t stay the whole night, but the time she spent with me truly made a difference. Even though labor was hard work and painful, the right breathing technique and support helped ease the pain. This is probably the number one thing that helped me get through labor!\n\nAs I started heading towards my second night of labor, I wondered how much longer I could go on \u2026 I questioned if it was even worth it to continue without an epidural? I went into labor without a plan. I wanted to go with the flow and make decisions as they came. I didn\u2019t want to be tied to a bed or deliver on my back or disappointed if my perfect labor didn\u2019t come true, so I left any expectations open. But after my second sleepless night, I started to inquire about pain medications (although deep down inside I knew I could handle more because the pain was still manageable). I was exhausted and sleep would have been nice especially if I didn\u2019t have to feel any pain with an epidural.\n\nThere were no walking epidurals available though and I didn\u2019t want to take narcotics (which could make me dizzy), so I continued along, breathing away. A bath was an option too and this I requested and wanted. I was so uncomfortable as things progressed. I couldn\u2019t get in the shower to relax my muscles, but somehow a bath sounded soothing and worth the effort. As soon as the bath was ready, however, I suddenly felt a pop down below as if major pressure had been released from my insides. Immediately, there was a shift. The back and butt pressure/pain I felt was no longer there. It was time to push! I knew as soon as I felt it.\n\nAs the baby descended, I felt the burning sensation of the babies head crowning \u2013 a temporary stretching sting. The cramps were still there and I had no control over my own pushing. I let my body do its own work and took the breaks my body provided in between each wave of labor. I was standing up giving birth because I couldn\u2019t get onto the bed as I would have liked and was given a stool to put my right foot onto in order to widen my pelvis. Gravity certainly assisted me. However, I never expected to be standing for 50 minutes! My legs were becoming tired and shaky, but I couldn\u2019t move. My energy was sapped and I regretted not exercising more. Standing up was the most comfortable thing to do though and I listened to my body\u2019s cues.\n\nI started to go along with my body\u2019s signals to push, but after a while I felt as if the baby would never come out because things weren\u2019t progressing fast enough. After his head came out, I thought it was all over until I heard my husband say \u201cpush, his body is stuck!\u201d I ended up pushing as hard as I could and a gush of fluids came spewing onto the floor. It was the best sense of relief.\n\nThe midwives held my baby from under me and told me to grab him. He was screaming, kicking, and punching his way into this life.

{"text": "But something is happening here and you don\u2019t know what it is\n\nDo you, Mr, Jones? (Bob Dylan, 1965)\n\nRulers seldom know what\u2019s happening, do they? They have the intelligence apparatus and their party politicos feeding them whatever the powerful like to hear, but the assessment of the people can be in delicious discord.\n\nAtal Bihari Vajpayee ordered elections early because his India was shining. He paid the price. Through cries of policy paralysis and corruption, Manmohan Singh went in expecting to be reasonably rewarded. After all, his government had delivered a nearly 7-8% (9-10% by today\u2019s yardstick) rate of growth over most of his ten-year period, unprecedented for a democracy. Yet, the result was a shock.\n\nWhat was common between the two governments \u2013 covering a period of about 16 years of elite section boy-scout optimism \u2013 was bubbly talk for much of the time by economists, policy wonks, and the World Bank and the IMF. In the end, the politics probably turned on a less talked about variable: jobless growth, which analysts hadn\u2019t troubled themselves with.\n\nIn the strapped situation of lukewarm private sector investment we are in today, and the major employment-generating informal economy sector having taken a hit since demonetisation, no analyst or political planner can afford to overlook jobless growth.\n\nPakora growth, a close enough synonym, staring the country in the face is hardly a pleasing outcome after four years of \u201cgame-changing\u201d economics, no matter how combatively BJP chief Amit Shah defended it in his maiden speech in the Rajya Sabha.\n\nYoung Indians of any class, on whose shoulders rides the much-vaunted promise of the demographic dividend, are not amused.\n\nRampant joblessness is a feature the Modi sarkar shares with the governments of Vajpayee and Singh. Alas, what it does not share with their time in office is a long patch of striking expansion of the economy.\n\nAlso Read\n\nNot to put too fine a point on it, we now find ourselves stuck in a time of creeping pessimism, although international capital has done its best to talk up the India story through friendly statements issued by the IMF and the World Bank that the Modi regimes perversely quotes all the time, though it only has to look around to find the truth.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, India is slipping when the US and Europe have recovered and when the international price of oil is still in benign territory.\n\nThe dim economic outlook is likely to impose a cut-and-run political strategy on the prime minister, although MPs in general, not just of the ruling party, do not like their term cut short.\n\nFor Modi, an early election is, therefore, likely to be a political compulsion. In this respect, his story is different from that of Vajpayee\u2019s. The latter had chosen to go to the country early of his own volition in order to seize what his advisors thought might be a bright moment.\n\nThe contrast in circumstances Modi finds himself in has been accentuated by the morale-sapping defeat in the recent by-elections in Rajasthan. Ordinarily, losing by-elections is not the end of the world, although ruling parties frequently coast to easy victories in them. However, the BJP lost every one of the 16 Assembly segments that make up the Lok Sabha constituencies of Alwar and Ajmer.\n\nThat is a lot of territory to lose in one go and should be a distinct worry for the saffron party. Rajasthan has an old and active RSS network, which in recent times was lubricated through political and social actions of the Hindutva variety, most notably cow vigilante actions. But none of this counted with the voter.\n\nThe \u201csecular\u201d realm \u2013 jobs, prices, the economy, living conditions \u2013 trumped the world of perverse ideas delivered slickly through clever propaganda disseminated not just by fanatical Hindutva outfits but also a section of the fawning media.\n\nAssembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhatisgarh are due in December this year and the Lok Sabha poll should in the normal course be held in April-May, 2019. However, when the prognosis for the BJP in these states is none too bright \u2013 and remember the bad news began to pour in from Modi\u2019s the home state Gujarat, where BJP\u2019s win was so tenuous that the party cannot even celebrate it \u2013 and the Rajasthan results hammered home a bitter truth, can the prime minister risk holding the Lok Sabha election after a potentially weak showing in three BJP-ruled states?\n\nThis will be the singular consideration guiding the prime minister if he decides to go to the country early, not some high-intentioned thinking on the presumed benefits to the country of holding parliament and state polls simultaneously.\n\nThe year 2017 began brilliantly for Modi and Amit Shah with a staggering win in Uttar Pradesh. But the year ended on a sobering note on account of the factors that became evident first in Gujarat and then in Rajasthan \u2013 rampant joblessness, farmers\u2019 plight, the woes of the working classes in the \u2018rurban\u2019 areas and in cities proper.

Under low Pi status, Pi uptake into the vacuole was strongly activated compared to high Pi status. Since Pi uptake across the vacuolar membrane is correlated with H+ pumping, we examined the dependency of H+ pumping on plant Pi status. Both H+ pumping and the activities of the vacuolar H+-pumps, the V-type H+-ATPase and the H+-PPase were enhanced under low Pi status.

The drives are configured in RAID 6.  \nYesterday, some kind of unknown \"event\" occurred and the array dropped offline.  We rebooted the server (running CENTOS 6.2) and upon startup, the Array Controller reported that 13 of the drives are \"missing\".

There are no more entries after 12.\nWe contacted HP support, who sent us to Tier 2 support, and after many hours gave up.

Are you running HP management agents?

If 1 cable is connected, then you likely have a backplane issue because of the SAS expander in the enclosure. \nIf two cables are connected, you may have a SAS cable, MSA70 controller or P800 port failure.\n\nYour data is likely intact, but you need to isolate the issue and determine which one of the above issues is the culprit.

{"text": "POV: Henry vs Martin + a poll\n\nI won\u2019t make claims as to their gifts and charms, but H & M do resemble me in various ways :)\n\nI usually like to write stories from a single point of view. It\u2019s obviously a limited perspective, but I enjoy the constraints. As far as I\u2019m concerned, there\u2019s no such thing as a reliable narrator. Characters misinterpret things, miss things, draw the wrong conclusions, and it can be tricky and fun to work the \u201ctruth\u201d into a story alongside the character\u2019s perceptions. For instance, I think it\u2019s obvious to the reader that Martin is DTF from the get-go, but Henry, equipped with the same amount of information, simply doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nWhen I started writing the Ganymede Quartet books, it seemed obvious to me that the story needed to be told from the master\u2019s point of view. Whether or not he\u2019s actually prepared to take responsibility, the fact remains that Henry\u2019s the one in charge and he sets the tone. It\u2019s Martin\u2019s job to adapt and respond and accommodate and serve. Obviously, Martin is better-equipped to steer this particular ship, but, unfortunately for Henry, the roles in this relationship weren\u2019t assigned based on fitness or merit. If you\u2019ve read A Most Personal Property (GQ Book 1), you know that when the opportunity finally arises for Martin to take charge, he does so with great effect, but he does wait for Henry to create the opportunity. He\u2019s very well-trained.\n\nI think it\u2019s apparent that Martin is miserable for most of AMPP, and writing weeks of self-doubt and misery even greater than Henry\u2019s, from the perspective of a character who has even less power to effect change\u2026I don\u2019t think anyone wants to read that book, actually.\n\nHenry also needed to be the POV character for the main books because Henry is the one who has the most growing to do. They\u2019re both young, both immature, but Martin is less immature, his sense of self is more solid and, well, he\u2019s a lot smarter. Henry learns a lot over the course of the series, which is not to say that Martin doesn\u2019t, but as the one nominally in charge, Henry\u2019s growth has a greater impact on both of them.\n\nIt was possibly something of a risk, but I left out or delayed certain trains of thought because Henry isn\u2019t necessarily considering all aspects and implications of the master/slave dynamic from early on in their relationship. He\u2019s very loving, but he\u2019s not the most insightful person, and it takes him awhile to consider things that a savvier fellow might have questioned from the beginning. It really does take Henry a long time to wonder how Martin\u2019s position and training impact the way Martin responds to him.\n\nI anticipate going a little deeper into Martin\u2019s background, in a way, for the story that will accompany Book 3. I also have a pretty good idea which aspect of Book 4 I\u2019ll present from Martin\u2019s perspective. So far, the Martin stories have been really fun to write, and I definitely look forward to doing them. I think they\u2019re so easy and enjoyable to work on because they revisit territory that I\u2019ve already covered from Henry\u2019s perspective to some extent, and when I\u2019m writing Henry, I\u2019m always considering how Martin might view a given situation, as well.\n\nOffering Martin\u2019s POV at all was actually a pretty late development. It occurred to me shortly before publishing A Most Personal Property that the stories I was busy telling myself about Martin\u2019s past would probably be of interest to anyone who was interested in AMPP, and so I quickly wrote A Superior Slave. I hoped that people who enjoyed reading ASS (ugh, that acronym!) for free might be interested in paying for AMPP, and I think that did happen to some small extent. I\u2019ve gotten the impression (whether it\u2019s true or not) that Martin might be the reader favorite by a small margin, so it just seems like a nice idea to continue offering Martin POV stories alongside the main books. While I think a person can enjoy the main books and Henry\u2019s POV without side stories, I like to think Martin\u2019s perspective is a valuable addition.\n\nI plan on adding additional points of view from other characters in the universe. I\u2019ve got stories written about a couple of Henry\u2019s friends to show how slave ownership works in private for other people. I\u2019ve got at least two stories I want to write about Henry\u2019s cousin Jesse. I think Tom gets his own novella :D\n\nWith A Proper Lover (GQ Book 2) and A Master\u2019s Fidelity (GQ Book 2.5) released, I\u2019m just going immediately into editing Book 3 and fleshing out the notes I have for the Martin story. I\u2019d had vague ideas about taking a break, but I honestly don\u2019t know what that would mean at this point. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d be doing during a break! Right now, the idea of downtime just makes me cranky. Knowing that there are people eager for the next books makes me want to work on getting them out. Besides, working on Martin\u2019s POV is a treat :)", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Pile-CC"}}

And while Republicans don\u2019t appear to be involved in the process, relevant GOP chairs in both chambers have expressed a willingness to work with Schatz on the issue.\n\nInitial reports indicate that Hawaii\u2019s screwup\u2014which sent people across the archipelago scrambling for shelter before the all-clear was called more than a half-hour later\u2014was because of an employee mistakenly pressing the wrong link on a confusingly designed interface. But for something as serious as a ballistic-missile alert, Schatz suggested that the potential for human error can, and should, be mitigated through federal safeguards.\n\n\u201cYou want a system that accounts for the fact that somebody may be sleepy or careless, or an interface may not be the most user-friendly, and yet it all works anyway,\u201d Schatz said. \u201cWe have best practices for disaster notifications for natural disasters, for terrorism events. We just don\u2019t have it for this.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Schatz said he had convened a phone call with officials from the Federal Communications Commission, the Homeland Security Department, the Pentagon, and other relevant agencies to address the inconsistency.\n\n\u201cWe think it should be done legislatively, but I don\u2019t know that for sure yet,\u201d he told reporters, explaining that the ultimate goal is to craft \u201ca federal law to establish a framework that states can use.\u201d\n\nThe way America\u2019s missile-alert system operates is fundamentally different from how citizens are alerted to most other catastrophes, when local authorities often possess the best information. While states and cities are ultimately responsible for alerting civilians of an imminent attack, they lack the ability to detect and track incoming missiles.\n\nIn the seconds and minutes after a launch, details of the threat would have to cascade through phone calls from the Pentagon to DHS. From there, officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency would send the warning to at-risk states and localities, whose own alert systems would only then spring into life.\n\nThat chain of causation was disrupted on Saturday. But David Simpson, a former admiral in the U.S. Navy who ran the FCC\u2019s Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau from November 2013 to January 2017, said federal legislation should seek to dismantle that outdated process altogether.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a 1950s kind of structure,\u201d Simpson said, arguing that machine-to-machine communication technology should be utilized to eliminate lag time and cut down on human error.\n\nOne way to do that could be for the FCC to create, at the direction of Congress, a unique wireless-alert category for ballistic-missile threats. \u201cThat would then ensure that the machine elements of this system could be built around that narrow bucket,\u201d Simpson said.\n\nBut that still wouldn\u2019t solve the problem entirely. \u201cThe machine-to-machine piece of that, so it could be really useful, would require DHS and [Defense Department] plumbing changes that would be beyond the authorities of the FCC,\u201d Simpson said.\n\nSimpson largely endorsed Schatz\u2019s plan for a uniform federal missile-alert framework that states and localities can follow. \u201cThere\u2019s over 1,000 alert originators at the state and local level, and I would say five, six, seven vendors for the user-interface systems,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a bid to improve innovation, DHS gave state governments broad leeway to design their own missile-alert interfaces. But Simpson said that decision has clearly come with a cost.\n\n\u201cThat variation is fine for notification about fire, notification about a tsunami coming in,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cBut ballistic-missile warnings ought to be consistent, reliable, secure\u2014because we don\u2019t want it cyberattacked\u2014across the entire country.\u201d\n\nRepublicans seem receptive to Schatz\u2019s plan for missile-alert legislation. Schatz said he plans to introduce his bill through the Senate Commerce Committee, which is chaired by Republican John Thune. Frederick Hill, a Thune spokesman, told National Journal that the chairman \u201cis considering convening a full committee hearing which would help inform legislative efforts.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans are further along than their Senate counterparts, with plans to hold an Energy and Commerce hearing on Hawaii\u2019s false missile alert in the coming weeks. On Wednesday, committee chairman Greg Walden said he would be \u201chappy to work\u201d with Schatz on legislation, if needed. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t got into the weeds on it,\u201d Walden said.\n\nAs long as lawmakers can work out issues surrounding committee and agency jurisdiction, Simpson said the chances for bipartisan support are high. But stakeholders from Homeland Security and the Pentagon\u2014as well as the congressional committees that oversee them\u2014will also need to weigh in. And Simpson worries those agencies may be loath to take responsibility for what\u2019s widely viewed as a state-level mistake.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect bipartisan issue, as long as we don\u2019t let the various lobbies and the competition between agencies pervert and potentially dilute the ultimate outcome,\u201d Simpson said.\n\n\"Two more House Republicans have joined the discharge petition to force votes on immigration, potentially leaving centrists just two signatures short of success. Reps. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) signed the discharge petition Thursday before the House left town for the Memorial Day recess. If all Democrats endorse the petition, just two more GOP signatures would be needed to reach the magic number of 218.\"\n\nSource:\n\nFIRED FROM RUSSIAN LAUNCHER\n\nInvestigators Pin Destruction of Malaysian Airliner on Russia\n\n3 hours ago\n\nTHE DETAILS\n\n\"A missile that brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in eastern Ukraine in 2014 was fired from a launcher belonging to Russia's 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade, investigators said Thursday.

It has also been getting a lot of heat as the star has put in thousands of air miles touring the major cities of the Middle Kingdom and doing promo work at the recent Beijing, Shanghai and Cannes festivals.\n\nThe giant screen brand has been popular with China\u2019s status-obsessed new middle classes. Chinese audiences are willing to pay hefty premium prices for the giant screen and amped up sound systems.\n\nSo popular that more movies are being made or converted for the format and that earlier this year IMAX quietly dropped its previous policy of just showing a single title on each screen. \u201cMan of Tai Chi\u201d will have to compete for screen space with \u201cMan of Steel,\u201d and by Variety\u2019s count it appears to be getting play at some 116 venues in its opening frame.\n\nChinese, and to a lesser extent Korean, producers have been the keenest non-Hollywood film-makers to embrace IMAX presentation and in Sept 2012 leading local studio Huayi Brothers pacted with IMAX to deliver a minimum of seven future movies in IMAX format.\n\nMore than half a dozen Chinese films have been made or converted into IMAX, four flowing from Huayi; the Feng Xiaogang-directed \u201cAftershock\u201d and \u201c1942,\u201d and the Stephen Fung comedy action pair \u201cTai Chi Zero\u201d and \u201cTai Chi Hero.\u201d Other studios have also jumped in: CFG with \u201cThe Great Revival;\u201d Bona Film Group with Tsui Hark\u2019s \u201cFlying Swords of Dragon Gate;\u201d and the Jackie Chan production-starring vehicle \u201cCZ12,\u201d which Huayi released.\n\nIMAX is a huge commercial success story in China. As of March this year, the company had 110 screens in operation in China, compared with just 10 in 2010. That makes China IMAX\u2019s second biggest territory behind the US and its top international location.\n\nChina has witnessed some of the most gargantuan orders for new screens. While cinema chains in other territories have ordered IMAX screens in ones and twos, Dalian Wanda in March 2011 put in an order for 75 screens. In Nov 2012 South Korea\u2019s CGV booked 15 IMAX screens for its expanding Chinese theater circuit.

{"text": "This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2000-159163, filed Mar. 31, 2000, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.\nThe present invention relates to a method of forming a composite member, in which a conductive portion is formed in an insulator, the composite member being used in, for example, a wiring board in the fields of electric appliances, electronic appliances and electric and electronic communication. The present invention also relates to a photosensitive composition and an insulating material that can be suitably used in the manufacturing method of the composite member. Further, the present invention relates to a composite member manufactured by the manufacturing method of the present invention and to a multi-layer wiring board and an electronic package including the particular composite member.\nIn recent years, increase in the degree of integration and miniaturization of various electric and electronic parts including a semiconductor device are being promoted. The particular tendency will be further promoted in the future without fail. In this connection, various measures are being proposed and tried in an attempt to apply a high density mounting to a printed circuit board including formation of a fine pattern and a fine pitch of a metal wiring and formation of a steric wiring.\nParticularly, the steric wiring is indispensable to a high density mounting and, thus, various methods are being proposed in an attempt to manufacture a wiring board having a steric wiring. In general, the steric wirings are of a multi-layered structure such as a built-up wiring board prepared by laminating two dimensional printed wiring boards and a multi-layered wiring board. It is difficult to form a steric wiring having a free three dimensional shape. The built-up wiring board or the multi-layered wiring board has a structure that adjacent wiring layers are connected to each other by a conductive column called via. The via is formed by processing an insulating layer by a photolithography process using a photosensitive polyimide or resist, followed by selectively applying a plating to the via or by filling the via with a conductive paste. For forming a via by such a method, it is necessary to repeat a plurality of times the steps of resist coating, light exposure and etching, making the via formation highly laborious. In addition, it is difficult to improve the yield.\nIt is also possible to form the via by forming a through-hole (via hole) of a predetermined size in an insulating substrate constituting a printed wiring board by using a drill or a CO2 laser, followed by applying plating to the via hole or by filling the via hole with a conductive paste. In these methods, however, it is difficult to form freely a fine via having a size of scores of microns or less at a desired position.\nIn the method disclosed in Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 7-207450, a compound having a hydrophilic group is introduced into pores of three dimensional porous film such as a PTFE film. Under this condition, the film is subjected to a light exposure in a predetermined pattern by using a low pressure mercury lamp (wave lengths of 185 nm and 254 nm), thereby forming the hydrophilic group on the three dimensional porous film. Further, a metal plating is applied to the three dimensional porous film.\nIn the conventional method described above, however, the material forming the three dimensional porous film is deteriorated because a light beam having a short wavelength is used for the light exposure. Also, the light for the light exposure is absorbed by the three dimensional porous film and, thus, fails to reach the inner region of the porous body, resulting in failure to form fine vias.\nFurther, in the conventional method described above, the PTFE forming the three dimensional porous film reacts with the light for the light exposure so as to selectively form hydrophilic groups. However, PTFE is defective in that the molding workability is low and that PTFE is costly.\nAnother method of forming a via is disclosed in Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 11-24977. In this method, the entire surface of a porous insulating member is impregnated with a photosensitive composition containing, for example, a photosensitive reducing agent and a metal salt. Then, a light exposure is applied in a predetermined pattern to the impregnated insulating member so as to reduce the cation of the metal salt in the light exposed portion to a metal nucleus, followed by removing by washing the photosensitive composition in the non-light exposed portion. Further, an electroless plating or a soldering is applied to the residual metal nuclei so as to form vias of a predetermined pattern.\nIn the method described above, however, the entire surface of the porous insulating member is impregnated with a photosensitive composition containing a metal salt as described above, making it difficult to remove completely the metal salt adsorbed on the portion corresponding to the non-exposed portion after the light exposure step. As a result, a difficulty is brought about that the metal nuclei are precipitated on undesired portions in the subsequent reducing step. Such an abnormal deposition of the metal nuclei gives rise to a problem in terms of the insulating properties between adjacent vias and between adjacent wiring layers with progress in the fine pulverization of the pattern.\nAlso, in the via formed in the insulating substrate by the conventional method of manufacturing a wiring board, the insulating body and the conductive portion are brought into a direct contact. In this case, since the adhesion between the insulating body and the conductive portion is poor, a problem is generated that the conductive portion is peeled off the insulating substrate during the use.\nFurther, where a multi-layered wiring board is prepared by laminating a plurality of wiring boards manufactured by the conventional method of manufacturing a wiring board, it is required to further improve the electrical connection between the wiring layers of the wiring boards and the conductivity of the wiring.\nAn object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a composite member, which has a high degree of freedom in the design of a conductive circuit, in which deterioration of the insulating body is not brought about by the light exposure, and which is free from an abnormal deposition of a metal on the insulating body so as to form a conductive portion having a fine pattern.\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a composite member, which has a high degree of freedom in the design of a conductive circuit, which permits manufacturing a composite member at a low manufacturing cost without giving adverse effects to the selectivity of the material of the insulating portion and to the molding workability, and which is free from an abnormal deposition of a metal on the insulating body so as to form a conductive portion having a fine pattern.\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide a photosensitive composition and an insulating material used for the manufacturing method of a composite member described above.\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide a composite member manufactured by the method described above.\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide a multi-layered wiring board comprising a composite member manufactured by the method described above.\nStill another object of the present invention is to provide an electronic package using a composite member or a multi-layered wiring board manufactured by the method described above.\nAccording to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a composite member in which a conductive portion is selectively formed in an insulating body, comprising:\n(1) forming a photosensitive composition layer within or on the surface of said insulating body, said photosensitive composition containing a compound forming an ion-exchange group upon irradiation with light having a wavelength not shorter than 280 nm;\n(2) exposing selectively the photosensitive composition layer to light having a wavelength not shorter than 280 nm so as to form ion-exchange groups in the light exposed portion;

A recent c-fos study indicated that the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMN) may be activated 2-3 h after ingestion of IAAD.

{"text": "The present invention relates generally to improved means and methods for processing documents using electronic imaging, and more particularly, to the use of electronic imaging for processing financial documents, such as checks and related documents in a banking environment.\nToday's financial services industry is facing the immense challenge of processing huge amounts of documents efficiently. Predictions that document payment methods would decline have not been realized. In fact, document payment methods have grown worldwide and are expected to continue increasing. There is thus a vital need to devise improved means and methods for processing such documents.\nThe use of imaging technology as an aid to document processing has been recognized as one way of significantly improving document processing, as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat.

Generally, imaging involves optically scanning documents to produce electronic images that are processed electronically and stored on high capacity storage media (such as magnetic disc drives and/or optical memory) for later retrieval and display. It is apparent that document imaging provides the opportunity to reduce document handling and movement, since these electronic images can be used in place of the actual documents.\nHowever, despite technological advances in imaging in recent years, prior art document processing systems employing imaging, such as disclosed in the aforementioned patents, do not realized sufficient improvements to justify the added implementations costs.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "USPTO Backgrounds"}}
{"text": "At our best, we motivate ourselves every day to get dressed and go to work or school. Although there are larger incentives at work, it's our own volition that powers us through our innumerable daily tasks.\n\nIf we could learn to control the motivational centers of our brains that drive volition, would it lead us toward healthier, more productive lives? Using a new brain imaging strategy, Duke University scientists have now taken a first step in understanding how to manipulate specific neural circuits using thoughts and imagery.\n\nThe technique, which is described in the March 16 issue of the journal Neuron, is part of a larger approach called 'neurofeedback,' which gives participants a dynamic readout of brain activity, in this case from a brain area critical for motivation.\n\n\"These methods show a direct route for manipulating brain networks centrally involved in healthy brain function and daily behavior,\" said the study's senior investigator R. Alison Adcock, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and associate director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience in the Duke University Institute for Brain Sciences.\n\nNeurofeedback is a specialized form of biofeedback, a technique that allows people to monitor aspects of their own physiology, such as heart rate and skin temperature. It can help generate strategies to overcome anxiety and stress or to cope with other medical conditions.\n\nNeurofeedback has historically relied on electroencephalography or EEG, in which patterns of electrical activity are monitored noninvasively by electrodes attached to the scalp. But these measures provide only rough estimates of where activity occurs in the brain.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn contrast, the new study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which measures changes in blood oxygen levels, allowing more precisely localized measurements of brain activity.\n\nAdcock's team has been working on ways to use thoughts and behavior to tune brain function for the past eight years. In this time, they've developed tools allowing them to analyze complex brain imaging data in real time and to display it to participants as neurofeedback while they are in the fMRI scanner.\n\nThis study focused on the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a small area deep within the brain that is a major source of dopamine, a neurochemical well known for its role in motivation, experiencing rewards, learning, and memory.\n\nAccording to Adcock's previous research, when people are given incentives to remember specific images, an increase in VTA activation before the image appears predicts whether the participants are going to successfully remember the image.\n\nExternal incentives like money work well to stimulate the VTA, but it was unclear whether people could exercise this area on their own, said co-author Jeff MacInnes, a postdoctoral researcher in Adcock's lab.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn the new study, the team encouraged participants in the scanner to generate feelings of motivation -- using their own personal strategies -- during 20-second intervals. They weren't able to raise their VTA activity consistently on their own.\n\nBut when the scientists provided participants with neurofeedback from the VTA, presented in the form of a fluctuating thermometer, participants were able to learn which strategies worked, and ultimately adopt more effective strategies. Compared to control groups, the neurofeedback-trained participants successfully elevated their VTA activity.\n\nParticipants reported using a variety of different motivational strategies, from imagining parents or coaches encouraging them, to playing out hypothetical scenarios in which their efforts were rewarded, said co-author Kathryn Dickerson, a postdoctoral researcher in Adcock's group.\n\nThe self-generated boost in VTA activation worked even after the thermometer display was removed. Only the participants who had received accurate neurofeedback were able to consistently raise their VTA levels.\n\n\"Because this is the first demonstration of its kind, there is much still to be understood,\" Adcock added. \"But these tools could offer benefits for everyone, particularly those with depression or attention problems.\"\n\nThe neurofeedback training also activated other regions involved in learning and experiencing rewards, confirming that, at least in the short term, the brain changes its activity more broadly as a result of neurofeedback, Dickerson said.\n\nAdcock said one caveat of the study is that the team has not tested whether the neurofeedback drove changes in behavior. The group is working on those studies now and also plans to conduct the same study in participants with depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nThis research was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (MH9743, MH100764), the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Esther A. & Joseph Klingenstein Fund, and the Dana Foundation.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

Trujillo \u2014 Criminal Law \u2014 Sentencing\n\u2014 Probation \u2014 Indeterminate Sentence\n\n     A division of the court of appeals considers whether a\n\nColorado statute authorizes imposition of a sentence to an\n\nindeterminate term of probation and whether the defendant was\n\nentitled to the benefit of amendments to the statute criminalizing\n\ntheft. Relying on People v. Jenkins, 2013 COA 76, 305 P.3d 420,\n\nthe division concludes that section 18-1.3-202(1), C.R.S. 2017,\n\nprovides statutory authority for the imposition of an indeterminate\n\nprobation sentence. Following People v.

Coffman, Attorney General, Joseph G. Michaels, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, Denver, Colorado, for Plaintiff-Appellee\n\nDouglas K. Wilson, Colorado State Public Defender, James S. Hardy, Deputy\nState Public Defender, Denver, Colorado, for Defendant-Appellant\n\f\u00b61    Defendant, Michael Floyd Trujillo, appeals his judgment of\n\n conviction entered on a jury verdict finding him guilty of one count\n\n of theft of more than $20,000 and one count of criminal mischief of\n\n $20,000 or more. He also appeals his sentence. We perceive no\n\n basis for reversing his convictions, but remand for the trial court to\n\n make findings of fact regarding the assessment of the costs of\n\n prosecution and to reclassify his theft conviction as a class 4 felony.\n\n                            I. Background\n\n\u00b62    In 2007, Trujillo began building a home, doing much of the\n\n labor himself and initially using his own money to fund the project.\n\n He later took out a construction loan from the victim, a bank, for\n\n just under $255,000. After construction was completed on the\n\n house, Trujillo stopped making his monthly loan payments. The\n\n bank declined to restructure the loan and initiated foreclosure\n\n proceedings in September 2010.\n\n\u00b63    Before the foreclosure sale, Trujillo removed or destroyed\n\n property in the house, including kitchen cabinets, countertops,\n\n interior and exterior doors, doorjambs and casings, flooring,\n\n baseboards, light fixtures, bathroom fixtures, the fireplace,\n\n handrails, the boiler, the air conditioner, and the garage door.\n\n\n                                    1\n\f Because of this damage, the house was appraised at $150,000;\n\n however, the appraiser estimated that if the house were in good\n\n repair, it would have been worth $320,000.\n\n\u00b64    Trujillo was charged with defrauding a secured creditor, theft\n\n of $20,000 or more, but less than $100,000, and criminal mischief\n\n of $20,000 or more, but less than $100,000. The jury found him\n\n not guilty of defrauding a secured creditor and guilty of theft and\n\n criminal mischief.\n\n\u00b65    On appeal, Trujillo raises six contentions: (1) the trial court\n\n erred in rejecting defense-tendered jury instructions; (2) the trial\n\n court erred in allowing evidence of a prior foreclosure against\n\n Trujillo; (3) prosecutorial misconduct during direct examination of a\n\n witness and closing rebuttal argument warrants reversal; (4) the\n\n trial court imposed an illegal sentence of indeterminate probation;\n\n (5) the trial court erred in awarding the People costs of prosecution;\n\n and (6) an amendment to the theft statute applies to his conviction.\n\n We perceive no basis for reversal with respect to the first four\n\n contentions, but agree with Trujillo\u2019s final two contentions. We\n\n therefore affirm the convictions and the sentence in part but vacate\n\n the sentence in part and remand with directions.\n\n\n                                    2\n\f                          II. Jury Instructions\n\n\u00b66    Trujillo asserts that the trial court erred in rejecting various\n\n jury instructions regarding his theory of the case. We disagree.\n\n                           A. Additional Facts\n\n\u00b67    Throughout trial, the defense\u2019s theory of the case was that\n\n Trujillo lacked the requisite intent to commit the charged offenses\n\n because he believed that the property he removed from the house\n\n belonged to him. The defense tendered five jury instructions related\n\n to this theory of the case.\n\n\u00b68    Trujillo\u2019s tendered jury instructions detailed property law\n\n concepts. For example, the first tendered instruction stated that\n\n \u201cthe person who has title to real property is still the owner of the\n\n property even if there is a lien or secured interest on the property.\u201d\n\n Another tendered instruction defined \u201ctitle,\u201d \u201cdeed of trust,\u201d and\n\n \u201cholder of a certificate of purchase[].\u201d One instruction described the\n\n lien theory detailed in section 38-35-117, C.R.S. 2017, and another\n\n instructed that title to property \u201cdoes not vest with the purchaser\n\n until eight days after [a] foreclosure sale.\u201d\n\n\u00b69    The trial court declined to give these instructions as tendered.\n\n However, portions of the defense-tendered instructions were\n\n\n                                     3\n\f  included in a final definitional jury instruction. The final\n\n  instructions defined \u201cdeed of trust\u201d and stated that the title to\n\n  property is transferred to the holder of the certificate of purchase\n\n  eight days after a foreclosure sale. Though it rejected other\n\n  portions of the defense-tendered instructions, the trial court\n\n  permitted defense counsel to argue the issues raised in the\n\n  instructions during closing argument.\n\n\u00b6 10   The defense also tendered an instruction which the trial court\n\n  modified and gave as a theory of the case instruction. That\n\n  instruction stated, \u201cTrujillo contends that the items removed from\n\n  the home . . . were his; purchased by him and installed by him. . . .\n\n  Trujillo conten[d]s that the items that he took and damaged were\n\n  his sole property.\u201d\n\n                         B. Standard of Review\n\n\u00b6 11   We review jury instructions de novo to determine whether, as\n\n  a whole, they accurately informed the jury of the governing law.\n\n  Riley v. People, 266 P.3d 1089, 1092-93 (Colo. 2011). If the jury\n\n  instructions properly inform the jury of the law, the district court\n\n  has \u201cbroad discretion to determine the form and style of jury\n\n  instructions.\u201d Day v. Johnson, 255 P.3d 1064, 1067 (Colo. 2011).\n\n\n                                     4\n\f  Accordingly, we review a trial court\u2019s decision concerning a\n\n  proposed jury instruction for an abuse of discretion and will not\n\n  disturb the ruling unless it is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or\n\n  unfair. Id.\n\n\u00b6 12   When a defendant objects to the trial court\u2019s ruling on a jury\n\n  instruction, we review for nonconstitutional harmless error and will\n\n  thus affirm if \u201cthere is not a reasonable probability that the error\n\n  contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d People v. Garcia, 28\n\n  P.3d 340, 344 (Colo. 2001) (quoting Salcedo v. People, 999 P.2d\n\n  833, 841 (Colo. 2000)).\n\n                            C. Applicable Law\n\n\u00b6 13   \u201c[A]n instruction embodying a defendant\u2019s theory of the case\n\n  must be given by the trial court if the record contains any evidence\n\n  to support the theory.\u201d People v. Nunez, 841 P.2d 261, 264 (Colo.\n\n  1992). Moreover, a trial court has \u201can affirmative obligation\u201d to\n\n  work with counsel to correct a tendered theory of the case\n\n  instruction \u201cor to incorporate the substance of such in an\n\n  instruction drafted by the court.\u201d Id. at 265; see also People v.\n\n  Tippett, 733 P.2d 1183, 1195 (Colo. 1987) (a trial court may refuse\n\n  to give an instruction already embodied in other instructions).\n\n\n                                     5\n\f\u00b6 14   In considering whether a jury was adequately informed of a\n\n  defendant\u2019s theory of the case, a reviewing court can take into\n\n  account whether defense counsel\u2019s closing argument \u201cfairly\n\n  represented\u201d the theory to the jury. People v. Dore, 997 P.2d 1214,\n\n  1222 (Colo. App. 1999).\n\n                               D. Analysis\n\n\u00b6 15   Trujillo contends that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\n  rejecting the tendered instructions. We disagree.\n\n\u00b6 16   Trujillo asserts that the tendered instructions were essential\n\n  because they communicated his theory of the case. However, the\n\n  trial court instructed the jury on his theory of the case in an\n\n  instruction that clearly stated that he believed the property he took\n\n  from the house was \u201chis sole property.\u201d To the extent that the trial\n\n  court had a duty to work with the defense in crafting a proper\n\n  theory of defense instruction, we conclude that the trial court\n\n  fulfilled that duty here by giving an alternative theory of the case\n\n  instruction that encompassed Trujillo\u2019s tendered instructions. See\n\n  Nunez, 841 P.2d at 265 n.9. Moreover, the trial court specifically\n\n  stated that defense counsel would be allowed to incorporate the\n\n\n\n\n                                     6\n\f  property law concepts into her closing argument, which defense\n\n  counsel did.\n\n\u00b6 17   Trujillo asserts that the instructions he tendered were\n\n  accurate statements of property law. In contrast, the People argue\n\n  that the instructions misstated the law as it applies in criminal\n\n  prosecutions for theft and criminal mischief. Because we conclude\n\n  that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in drafting a theory\n\n  of defense instruction that encompassed the defense\u2019s tendered\n\n  instructions, we do not address whether the rejected instructions\n\n  were accurate statements of the law.\n\n\u00b6 18   The jury instructions, as a whole, \u201cfairly and adequately\n\n  cover[ed] the issues presented.\u201d People v. Pahl, 169 P.3d 169, 183\n\n  (Colo. App. 2006). Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not\n\n  abuse its discretion in rejecting in part the defense-tendered jury\n\n  instructions.\n\n                    III. Evidence of Prior Foreclosure\n\n\u00b6 19   Trujillo next asserts that the trial court erred in allowing the\n\n  People to introduce evidence that another property of his had been\n\n  foreclosed. We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n                                     7\n\f                           A. Additional Facts\n\n\u00b6 20   Before trial, Trujillo filed a motion to exclude evidence of other\n\n  acts or res gestae evidence. Trujillo\u2019s motion addressed several\n\n  categories of other acts evidence, including evidence related to any\n\n  \u201cfinancial and/or legal problems\u201d unrelated to the charged offenses.\n\n  During a motions hearing, the People stated that they did not\n\n  intend to introduce any other acts or res gestae evidence. In a\n\n  written ruling, the trial court granted Trujillo\u2019s motion to exclude\n\n  evidence of his unrelated financial and legal problems \u201cunless the\n\n  prosecution fe[lt] that the \u2018door ha[d] been opened.\u2019\u201d The trial court\n\n  further ordered that, if the People felt Trujillo introduced evidence of\n\n  his other financial and legal problems, the People could request a\n\n  bench conference during trial.\n\n\u00b6 21   On the first day of trial, defense counsel stated that she was\n\n  withdrawing her motion to exclude other acts evidence insofar as it\n\n  pertained to evidence of Trujillo\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. During\n\n  her opening statement, defense counsel then mentioned those\n\n  proceedings.\n\n\u00b6 22   Later, the People called the bank\u2019s former vice president as an\n\n  expert witness. During direct examination, the prosecutor asked\n\n\n                                     8\n\f  the witness why the bank had declined to restructure Trujillo\u2019s\n\n  loan. The prosecutor also asked about Trujillo\u2019s demeanor during\n\n  interactions with the bank. Trujillo objected. After a bench\n\n  conference, the trial court allowed the witness to testify on both\n\n  matters.\n\n\u00b6 23   Specifically, the witness testified that, during a conversation\n\n  about restructuring the loan, Trujillo \u201cseemed like he was very\n\n  upset.\u201d The witness recalled, \u201cHe got into [that] he had a piece of\n\n  property that [another bank] had foreclosed on and it sounded like\n\n  they had sold it for what [Trujillo] believed was a lot less, leaving\n\n  him a large deficiency balance.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 24   During closing argument, the People alluded to the witness\u2019s\n\n  testimony and referred several times to Trujillo\u2019s general animosity\n\n  against banks.\n\n                          B. Standard of Review\n\n\u00b6 25   We review a trial court\u2019s decision to admit other acts or res\n\n  gestae evidence for an abuse of discretion. People v. Jimenez, 217\n\n  P.3d 841, 846 (Colo. App. 2008). A court abuses its discretion if its\n\n  decision to admit such evidence is manifestly arbitrary,\n\n  unreasonable, or unfair. Id.\n\n\n                                      9\n\f\u00b6 26   We review a preserved claim of nonconstitutional error for\n\n  harmless error, reversing only if any error \u201csubstantially influenced\n\n  the verdict or affected the fairness of the trial proceedings.\u201d Hagos\n\n  v. People, 2012 CO 63, \u00b6 12, 288 P.3d 116, 119 (quoting Tevlin v.\n\n  People, 715 P.2d 338, 342 (Colo. 1986)).\n\n                           C. Applicable Law\n\n\u00b6 27   Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the\n\n  existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of\n\n  the action more probable or less probable than it would be without\n\n  the evidence.\u201d CRE 401. Generally speaking, \u201c[t]he Colorado Rules\n\n  of Evidence strongly favor the admission of relevant evidence.\u201d\n\n  People v. Brown, 2014 COA 155M-2, \u00b6 22, 360 P.3d 167, 172.\n\n  However, relevant evidence is nevertheless inadmissible when \u201cits\n\n  probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\n\n  prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\u201d CRE\n\n  403. Similarly, evidence of \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts\u201d is\n\n  inadmissible to prove a person\u2019s character \u201cin order to show that he\n\n  acted in conformity therewith,\u201d though it may be admissible for\n\n  other purposes, including proving intent. CRE 404(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                    10\n\f\u00b6 28   \u201cRes gestae is a theory of relevance which recognizes that\n\n  certain evidence is relevant because of its unique relationship to the\n\n  charged crime.\u201d People v. Greenlee, 200 P.3d 363, 368 (Colo. 2009).\n\n  However, \u201cthere is no need to consider an alternative theory of\n\n  relevance, such as res gestae, where the evidence is admissible\n\n  under general rules of relevancy.\u201d Id.\n\n                               D. Analysis\n\n\u00b6 29   Trujillo contends that the evidence of the prior foreclosure\n\n  action portrayed him as a \u201cserial defaulter\u201d and was impermissible\n\n  under CRE 404(b) and 403. The People assert that the evidence\n\n  was admissible as \u201cdirectly relevant\u201d to Trujillo\u2019s intent and motive.\n\n  In the alternative, the People argue that the evidence was res gestae\n\n  evidence. We agree with the People\u2019s first argument that the\n\n  evidence was admissible under CRE 401, and was not barred by\n\n  CRE 403.1\n\n\n\n  1 During the bench conference, the trial court allowed the bank\u2019s\n  former vice president to testify after conducting an abbreviated CRE\n  404(b) analysis that did not specifically address the four-factor test\n  set forth in People v. Spoto, 795 P.2d 1314, 1318 (Colo. 1990). The\n  trial court did not admit the evidence under the res gestae doctrine.\n  However, we can affirm a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling on any\n  ground supported by the record, \u201ceven if that ground was not\n\n                                    11\n\f\u00b6 30   The evidence of the prior foreclosure was probative of the\n\n  interactions between Trujillo and the bank \u2014 it made it more\n\n  probable that Trujillo had the requisite intent to commit theft. It\n\n  was therefore relevant under CRE 401. Further, the risk of unfair\n\n  prejudice did not substantially outweigh the probative value of the\n\n  evidence, especially where the prior foreclosure was referenced only\n\n  in passing and the details of that foreclosure were not revealed.\n\n  Thus, the evidence was not barred by CRE 403.\n\n\u00b6 31   Because we conclude that the evidence of the prior foreclosure\n\n  was relevant under CRE 401 and admissible under CRE 403, we\n\n  need not address whether the evidence was res gestae evidence or\n\n  \u201cother acts\u201d evidence under CRE 404(b). See Greenlee, 200 P.3d at\n\n  368-69. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in\n\n  allowing the testimony concerning the prior foreclosure action.\n\n                      IV. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n\u00b6 32   Trujillo argues that the prosecutor improperly commented on\n\n  the district attorney\u2019s screening process for bringing charges and\n\n\n\n\n  articulated or considered by the trial court.\u201d People v. Phillips, 2012\n  COA 176, \u00b6 63, 315 P.3d 136, 153.\n\n                                    12\n\f  Trujillo\u2019s right not to testify, and improperly denigrated defense\n\n  counsel. We perceive no basis for reversal.\n\n                           A. Additional Facts\n\n\u00b6 33   During redirect examination of one of the People\u2019s expert\n\n  witnesses, an attorney who worked at the bank, the prosecutor\n\n  asked whether the bank played a role in charging Trujillo. The\n\n  prosecutor asked if the witness himself made the decision to file a\n\n  criminal case, to which the witness replied, \u201cNo.\u201d The prosecutor\n\n  then asked, \u201c[W]ho is it, according to your understanding, that\n\n  makes those decisions on whether a case gets filed criminally?\u201d The\n\n  witness responded, \u201cA complaint\u2019s made to a police department or\n\n  sheriff\u2019s department and they make that decision in conjunction\n\n  with I believe you.\u201d The prosecutor clarified that \u201cyou\u201d meant the\n\n  district attorney\u2019s office. The defense did not object.\n\n\u00b6 34   During rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor said,\n\n             Did you hear all that? [Defense counsel]\u2019s\n             talking about all of this stuff, about what\n             Trujillo\u2019s intent was. And then did you hear\n             her towards the end what she did? She says,\n             and correct \u2013 this part was correct of what she\n             said. My job is to prove intent, right. That is\n             my burden. And she\u2019s absolutely right. The\n             Defendant has every right to remain silent,\n\n\n\n                                    13\n\f            and he exercised that right and that is\n            something that you cannot use against him.\n\n            But it is completely ridiculous for [defense\n            counsel] to get up here and say that [Trujillo]\n            didn\u2019t testify to what his intent was and then\n            to go on and talk about what his intent\n            actually was. We don\u2019t know what his intent\n            was because he never testified to that, which\n            he has every right to do. But did you hear\n            her? She\u2019s up here saying his intent was this.\n\n\u00b6 35   Trujillo objected on the basis that the prosecutor was\n\n  denigrating defense counsel. The trial court sustained the objection\n\n  as to the prosecutor\u2019s tone, but overruled it as to content. The\n\n  prosecutor then argued, \u201c[I]f you go out and run somebody over and\n\n  \u2013 and think that you had the right to do that, is that gonna be a\n\n  legitimate defense by saying, well, I thought I could do that. I didn\u2019t\n\n  \u2013 nobody ever told me. Nobody put it in writing. When I bought my\n\n  car, in the instruction manual, nothing said that about that. That\u2019s\n\n  preposterous.\u201d Trujillo did not renew his objection.\n\n                         B. Standard of Review\n\n\u00b6 36   In reviewing alleged prosecutorial misconduct, an appellate\n\n  court engages in a two-step analysis. First, we determine whether\n\n  the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was improper based on the totality of the\n\n  circumstances. Wend v. People, 235 P.3d 1089, 1096 (Colo. 2010).\n\n\n                                    14\n\f  Second, we determine whether any misconduct warrants reversal\n\n  under the proper standard of review. Id.\n\n\u00b6 37   When the alleged misconduct is objected to at trial and is of\n\n  constitutional magnitude, we review for constitutional harmless\n\n  error. Id. When the alleged misconduct is not of a constitutional\n\n  magnitude, and when the defense objected at trial, we subject the\n\n  prosecutorial misconduct to harmless error review. Id. at 1097.\n\n  Such prosecutorial misconduct will be considered harmless\n\n  \u201cwhenever there is no reasonable probability that it contributed to\n\n  the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d Crider v. People, 186 P.3d 39, 42 (Colo.\n\n  2008). When the defense did not object to the misconduct, we\n\n  review for plain error. Wend, 235 P.3d at 1097-98.\n\n                           C. Applicable Law\n\n\u00b6 38   A prosecutor cannot comment on a \u201cscreening process\u201d for\n\n  charging cases \u201cbecause it both hints that additional evidence\n\n  supporting guilt exists and reveals the personal opinion of the\n\n  prosecutor.\u201d Domingo-Gomez v. People, 125 P.3d 1043, 1052 (Colo.\n\n  2005). It is also improper for a prosecutor to make remarks \u201cfor the\n\n  obvious purpose of denigrating defense counsel.\u201d People v. Jones,\n\n  832 P.2d 1036, 1038 (Colo. App. 1991). It is similarly improper for\n\n\n                                   15\n\f  a prosecutor to comment on a defendant\u2019s decision not to testify.\n\n  Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 614 (1965); see also People v.\n\n  Martinez, 652 P.2d 174, 177 (Colo. App. 1981) (noting that a\n\n  prosecutor\u2019s comment on a defendant\u2019s silence constitutes\n\n  reversible error when \u201cthe prosecution argued that such silence\n\n  constituted an implied admission of guilt\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 39   Nevertheless, \u201c[a] prosecutor is allowed considerable latitude\n\n  in responding to the argument made by opposing counsel.\u201d People\n\n  v. Ramirez, 997 P.2d 1200, 1211 (Colo. App. 1999), aff\u2019d, 43 P.3d\n\n  611 (Colo. 2001). Further, \u201c[a]lthough it is improper for a\n\n  prosecutor to assert that opposing counsel knows that the\n\n  accused\u2019s case is not meritorious,\u201d the prosecutor may permissibly\n\n  argue \u201cthat the evidence in support of defendant\u2019s innocence lacked\n\n  substance.\u201d Id. at 1211; see also People v. Samson, 2012 COA 167,\n\n  \u00b6 31, 302 P.3d 311, 317 (stating that a prosecutor may permissibly\n\n  \u201ccomment on the absence of evidence to support a defendant\u2019s\n\n  contentions\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 40   Appellate courts consider several factors in determining\n\n  whether prosecutorial misconduct was prejudicial, including the\n\n  nature of the error, the pervasiveness of the misconduct, the\n\n\n                                    16\n\f  context, and the overall strength of the evidence supporting the\n\n  conviction. People v. McBride, 228 P.3d 216, 225 (Colo. App. 2009);\n\n  see also Crider, 186 P.3d at 43. For example, a reviewing court may\n\n  consider whether proper jury instructions mitigated the prejudicial\n\n  effect of prosecutorial misconduct. See People v. Castillo, 2014 COA\n\n  140M, \u00b6 78, ___ P.3d ___, ___ (concluding prosecutor\u2019s\n\n  misstatements were harmless in light of instructions from the trial\n\n  court and the defense\u2019s closing argument) (cert. granted in part Nov.\n\n  23, 2015).\n\n                               D. Analysis\n\n\u00b6 41   Trujillo contends that three instances of prosecutorial\n\n  misconduct require reversal. We disagree.\n\n\u00b6 42   Trujillo first contends that the prosecutor improperly referred\n\n  to a screening process while examining the expert witness. We\n\n  perceive no prosecutorial misconduct. The prosecutor here did not\n\n  imply that he had engaged in a screening process to \u201cweed out the\n\n  weaker cases and, implicitly, that the State d[id] not consider this a\n\n  weak case.\u201d Domingo-Gomez, 125 P.3d at 1052 (concluding the\n\n  prosecutor\u2019s comment that \u201cit takes a lot more than somebody\n\n  saying that person did it\u201d to bring charges was improper). Rather,\n\n\n                                    17\n\f  the prosecutor clarified that the bank did not bring criminal\n\n  charges and that the witness himself did not stand to gain as a\n\n  result of Trujillo\u2019s conviction. The People assert, and we agree, that\n\n  the prosecutor\u2019s question merely elicited testimony to establish that\n\n  the district attorney\u2019s office was responsible for pursuing the\n\n  criminal charges against Trujillo.\n\n\u00b6 43   Second, Trujillo asserts that the prosecutor impermissibly\n\n  commented on his decision not to testify. We disagree. Even if we\n\n  assume the comment on Trujillo\u2019s decision not to testify was\n\n  improper, not every comment on a defendant\u2019s choice not to testify\n\n  requires reversal. See Martinez, 652 P.2d at 177. \u201cThe determining\n\n  factor is whether the defendant\u2019s silence was used by the\n\n  prosecution as a means of creating an inference of guilt,\u201d id., and\n\n  we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments here did not raise\n\n  such an inference.\n\n\u00b6 44   Finally, Trujillo contends that the prosecutor impermissibly\n\n  denigrated defense counsel and the defense\u2019s theory of the case\n\n  during rebuttal closing argument. We agree that the prosecutor\n\n  improperly denigrated defense counsel and the defense\u2019s theory of\n\n\n\n\n                                       18\n\f  the case when he characterized her arguments as \u201ccompletely\n\n  ridiculous\u201d and \u201cpreposterous.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 45   However, we perceive no basis for reversal as a result of these\n\n  improper remarks. The comments were limited to the People\u2019s\n\n  rebuttal closing argument. Moreover, significant evidence\n\n  corroborated the jury\u2019s finding of guilt \u2014 specifically, the\n\n  undisputed evidence that Trujillo had removed an extensive amount\n\n  of property from the house. Viewing the record as a whole, we\n\n  cannot say that there was a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the\n\n  prosecutor\u2019s remarks denigrating defense counsel contributed to\n\n  Trujillo\u2019s convictions. See Crider, 186 P.3d at 42. Thus, we\n\n  determine the error was harmless.\n\n\u00b6 46   In sum, though we agree that the prosecutor improperly\n\n  denigrated defense counsel, we perceive no basis for reversal.\n\n                       V. Indeterminate Probation\n\n\u00b6 47   Trujillo contends that the trial court did not have the statutory\n\n  authority to sentence him to indeterminate probation. We disagree.\n\n                           A. Additional Facts\n\n\u00b6 48   During the sentencing hearing, the People requested that\n\n  Trujillo be placed on a \u201clong period of probation . . . somewhere in\n\n\n                                    19\n\f  the neighborhood of eight to ten years\u201d because they anticipated\n\n  that Trujillo would be ordered to pay substantial restitution.2\n\n  Trujillo requested unsupervised probation with a collections\n\n  investigator monitoring his restitution payments.\n\n\u00b6 49   The trial court imposed an \u201cindefinite probation sentence\u201d\n\n  because of the substantial restitution that Trujillo was expected to\n\n  owe. In imposing an indeterminate probation sentence, the trial\n\n  court stated, \u201cThere is case law that talks about whether\n\n  [indeterminate probation] is something that can or should be\n\n  imposed and it\u2019s certainly something that is allowed regardless of\n\n  the type of conviction that has been entered.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 50   The mittimus states that the sentence imposed was a term of\n\n  probation for seven years to life.\n\n                          B. Standard of Review\n\n\u00b6 51   The People contend that we should not consider this claim\n\n  because a sentence to probation is not ordinarily subject to\n\n\n\n  2 The trial court ultimately ordered Trujillo to pay $171,421.97 in\n  restitution. Trujillo separately appealed that order, and a division\n  of this court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for\n  reconsideration. People v. Trujillo, (Colo. App. No. 14CA2486, Oct.\n  5, 2017) (not published pursuant to C.A.R. 35(e)).\n\n                                       20\n\f  appellate review. However, \u201cwhere, as here, a defendant contends\n\n  that \u2018a court has exceeded its statutory authority\u2019 in imposing a\n\n  probationary sentence, appellate review is warranted.\u201d People v.\n\n  Jenkins, 2013 COA 76, \u00b6 10, 305 P.3d 420, 423 (quoting People v.\n\n  Rossman, 140 P.3d 172, 174 (Colo. App. 2006)).\n\n\u00b6 52   \u201cWe review sentencing decisions that are within the statutory\n\n  range for an abuse of discretion.\u201d People v. Torrez, 2013 COA 37,\n\n  \u00b6 71, 316 P.3d 25, 37. However, where the defendant contends that\n\n  a court exceeded its statutory sentencing authority, our inquiry\n\n  involves statutory interpretation. Jenkins, \u00b6 12, 305 P.3d at 423.\n\n  We review such issues of statutory interpretation de novo. Id.\n\n                           C. Applicable Law\n\n\u00b6 53   Under section 18-1.3-202(1)(a), C.R.S. 2017, a trial court \u201cmay\n\n  grant the defendant probation for such period and upon such terms\n\n  and conditions as it deems best.\u201d Further, \u201c[t]he length of probation\n\n  shall be subject to the discretion of the court and may exceed the\n\n  maximum period of incarceration authorized for the classification of\n\n  the offense of which the defendant is convicted.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 54   In Jenkins, a division of this court concluded that section 18-\n\n  1.3-202(1) \u201cauthorizes a trial court to impose an indeterminate term\n\n\n                                   21\n\f  of probation.\u201d Jenkins, \u00b6 38, 305 P.3d at 426. The Jenkins division\n\n  bolstered its conclusion by looking to the plain language of the\n\n  statute \u2014 which the division noted \u201ccontemplate[s] both\n\n  determinate and indeterminate terms of probation\u201d \u2014 and to the\n\n  provision\u2019s legislative history. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 40, 42, 46, 305 P.3d at 426-\n\n  28. Finally, the division noted that section 18-1.3-202(1) \u201cgenerally\n\n  pertains to a broad class of cases, and it simply allows a trial court\n\n  to elect an indeterminate term if it sentences an offender who has\n\n  been convicted of a felony to probation.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 50, 305 P.3d at\n\n  428 (upholding probationary sentence of ten years to life); see also\n\n  People v. Martinez, 844 P.2d 1203, 1206 (Colo. App. 1992)\n\n  (concluding that a trial court has authority to impose a term of\n\n  probation that exceeds the sentence to imprisonment in the\n\n  statutory aggravated range for an offense).\n\n                               D. Analysis\n\n\u00b6 55   Trujillo asserts that the trial court exceeded its statutory\n\n  authority in imposing an indeterminate probationary sentence. We\n\n  disagree.\n\n\u00b6 56   Like the Jenkins division, we conclude that section 18-1.3-\n\n  202(1) gives a trial court the authority to sentence a defendant\n\n\n                                    22\n\f  convicted of a felony to an indefinite probationary period. Trujillo\n\n  urges that the statute limits a trial court\u2019s authority to impose an\n\n  indeterminate probation sentence. Under Trujillo\u2019s logic, a sentence\n\n  to probation for 100 years is permissible, but an indeterminate\n\n  probation sentence is outside the trial court\u2019s statutory authority.\n\n  The statute offers no basis for reaching this conclusion.\n\n\u00b6 57   Trujillo asserts that Jenkins is distinguishable because that\n\n  case concerned whether a defendant convicted of a sex offense not\n\n  falling under the supervision scheme of the Colorado Sex Offender\n\n  Lifetime Supervision Act of 1998 (SOLSA), see \u00a7\u00a7 18-1.3-1001\n\n  to -1012, C.R.S. 2017, could nevertheless be sentenced to\n\n  indeterminate probation. Jenkins, \u00b6 1, 305 P.3d at 422. Trujillo\n\n  contends that Jenkins was limited to the particular circumstances\n\n  of that case, and does not widely apply to all offenses and\n\n  defendants. However, the Jenkins division made clear that section\n\n  18-1.3-202(1) \u201cestablishes a general rule as far as the possibility of\n\n  an indeterminate probationary term for felonies\u201d and \u201cauthorizes a\n\n  trial court to impose an indeterminate term of probation.\u201d Id. at\n\n  \u00b6\u00b6 38, 50, 305 P.3d at 426, 428. In fact, Jenkins explicitly rejected\n\n  the argument that a sentence of indeterminate probation could be\n\n\n                                    23\n\f  imposed only in sex offense cases subject to SOLSA. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 49-\n\n  50, 305 P.3d at 428. Thus, Trujillo\u2019s argument that Jenkins is\n\n  limited to sex offenses is unavailing.\n\n\u00b6 58   In sum, we conclude that the trial court did not exceed its\n\n  statutory authority in imposing the probation sentence here.\n\n                         VI. Costs of Prosecution\n\n\u00b6 59   Trujillo next asserts that the trial court erred in awarding the\n\n  full costs of prosecution requested by the People without making a\n\n  finding on whether any portion of the costs was attributable to the\n\n  charge on which he was acquitted. We agree.\n\n                           A. Additional Facts\n\n\u00b6 60   Before sentencing, the People moved for reimbursement of the\n\n  costs of prosecution pursuant to section 18-1.3-701, C.R.S. 2017.\n\n  The People requested $768.70. Trujillo opposed the motion on the\n\n  basis that the People bore responsibility for the costs incurred to\n\n  prove the defrauding a secured creditor charge, of which Trujillo\n\n  was acquitted.\n\n\u00b6 61   During the sentencing hearing, the trial court awarded the\n\n  requested costs of prosecution, ordering Trujillo to pay $768.70.\n\n\n\n\n                                    24\n\f                          B. Standard of Review\n\n\u00b6 62   The trial court, in its discretion, may assess reasonable and\n\n  necessary costs of prosecution against a convicted defendant. See\n\n  \u00a7 18-1.3-701(2)(j.5). Thus, we review an assessment of costs of\n\n  prosecution for an abuse of discretion, reversing if the trial court\u2019s\n\n  determination is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or unfair,\n\n  People v. Palomo, 272 P.3d 1106, 1110 (Colo. App. 2011), or if the\n\n  trial court misapplied the law, People v. Jefferson, 2017 CO 35,\n\n  \u00b6 25, 393 P.3d 493, 499.\n\n                             C. Applicable Law\n\n\u00b6 63   Under section 16-18-101(1), C.R.S. 2017, the state bears the\n\n  costs of prosecution when a defendant is acquitted. Such costs\n\n  may include witness fees, mileage, lodging expenses, transportation\n\n  costs, and other reasonable and necessary costs that directly result\n\n  from prosecuting the defendant. \u00a7 18-1.3-701(2); see also People v.\n\n  Sinovcic, 2013 COA 38, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 304 P.3d 1176, 1179. If a\n\n  defendant is convicted of fewer than all of the charged counts, the\n\n  court may assess only those costs attributable to the counts for\n\n  which the defendant was convicted, if an allocation is practicable.\n\n  Palomo, 272 P.3d at 1112.\n\n\n                                    25\n\f                               D. Analysis\n\n\u00b6 64   Trujillo asserts that the trial court erred in not making a\n\n  finding as to whether some portion of the requested costs of\n\n  prosecution were allocable to the acquitted charge. We agree.\n\n\u00b6 65   As Trujillo concedes, it is possible that the costs cannot be\n\n  allocated between the charge on which he was acquitted and the\n\n  two charges on which he was convicted. However, the trial court\n\n  did not find that such an allocation was impracticable. Because the\n\n  trial court was required to consider whether some portion of the\n\n  requested costs was practicably attributable to the acquitted\n\n  charge, the trial court abused its discretion. See DeBella v. People,\n\n  233 P.3d 664, 667 (Colo. 2010) (failure to exercise discretion\n\n  constitutes an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion).\n\n\u00b6 66   Accordingly, we vacate the order awarding the People costs of\n\n  prosecution and remand for the trial court to make appropriate\n\n  findings of fact and \u201cassess only those costs that are related to the\n\n  prosecution of the . . . counts of which [Trujillo] was convicted, to\n\n  the extent an allocation is practicable.\u201d Palomo, 272 P.3d at 1113.\n\n\n\n\n                                    26\n\f                    VII. Amendment to Theft Statute\n\n\u00b6 67   Trujillo contends that he should have benefited from an\n\n  amendment to the theft statute reclassifying theft between $20,000\n\n  and $100,000 as a class 4 felony. We agree.\n\n                            A. Additional Facts\n\n\u00b6 68   The General Assembly amended the theft statute on June 5,\n\n  2013. See Ch. 373, sec. 1, \u00a7 18-4-401, 2013 Colo. Sess. Laws\n\n  2196. Under the amended statute, theft between $20,000 and\n\n  $100,000 constitutes a class 4 felony. See \u00a7 18-4-401(2)(h), C.R.S.\n\n  2017. Prior to the amendment, theft over $20,000 constituted a\n\n  class 3 felony. \u00a7 18-4-401(2)(d), C.R.S. 2011.\n\n\u00b6 69   Trujillo was charged with theft of $20,000 or more in April\n\n  2011. He was convicted in October 2013 and sentenced in\n\n  December 2013. His theft conviction was recorded on the mittimus\n\n  as a class 3 felony.\n\n                         B. Standard of Review\n\n\u00b6 70   The People assert that, because Trujillo did not make this\n\n  argument before the trial court, we should review only for plain\n\n  error. However, the division in People v. Stellabotte rejected this\n\n  argument. 2016 COA 106, \u00b6 42, ___ P.3d ___, ___ (noting that plain\n\n\n                                    27\n\f  error review was inappropriate because \u201ca defendant may raise a\n\n  claim at any time that his or her sentence was not authorized by\n\n  law\u201d) (cert. granted Feb. 6, 2017). Following Stellabotte, we review\n\n  the legality of the sentence de novo. Id. at \u00b6 4, ___ P.3d at ___.\n\n                             C. Applicable Law\n\n\u00b6 71   In determining whether to apply amendments to legislation,\n\n  we first look to the plain language of the statute. People v.\n\n  Summers, 208 P.3d 251, 253-54 (Colo. 2009). If a statute explicitly\n\n  states that it applies only to offenses committed after the effective\n\n  date, it must be applied accordingly. See People v. McCoy, 764 P.2d\n\n  1171, 1174 (Colo. 1988).\n\n\u00b6 72   As a general rule, \u201c[a] statute is presumed to be prospective in\n\n  its operation.\u201d \u00a7 2-4-202, C.R.S. 2017. However, if a statute is\n\n  silent as to whether it applies only prospectively, a defendant may\n\n  seek retroactive application if he or she benefits from a significant\n\n  change in the law. \u00a7 18-1-410(1)(f)(I), C.R.S. 2017; see also People\n\n  v. Thornton, 187 Colo. 202, 203, 529 P.2d 628, 628 (1974) (allowing\n\n  defendant to seek relief on direct appeal under statute).\n\n\u00b6 73   In Stellabotte, a division of this court concluded that the\n\n  amendatory theft legislation \u201capplies retroactively to cases pending\n\n\n                                    28\n\f  in the trial court when the amendment was enacted.\u201d Stellabotte,\n\n  \u00b6 45, ___ P.3d at ___; People v. Patton, 2016 COA 187, \u00b6 32, ___ P.3d\n\n  ___, ___; see also People v. Patton, (Colo. App. No. 14CA2359, Aug.\n\n  11, 2016) (not published pursuant to C.A.R. 35(e)) (cert. granted\n\n  Feb. 6, 2017).\n\n                                D. Analysis\n\n\u00b6 74   Trujillo contends that the amendment to the theft statute\n\n  requires that we vacate his sentence and remand for the trial court\n\n  to enter his theft conviction as a class 4 felony. We agree.\n\n\u00b6 75   As the division noted in Stellabotte, the theft amendment does\n\n  not explicitly state that it is either retroactive or prospective.\n\n  Stellabotte, \u00b6 45, ___ P.3d at ___. In the face of this legislative\n\n  silence, the division held that a defendant who committed theft\n\n  prior to the statutory amendment but was not convicted until after\n\n  its passage was entitled to the benefit retroactively. See id. at\n\n  \u00b6\u00b6 39, 45, ___ P.3d at ___. The same is true here.\n\n\u00b6 76   Trujillo was charged with theft before the statute was\n\n  amended, but was not convicted or sentenced until after the\n\n  General Assembly lowered the classification for theft between\n\n\n\n\n                                      29\n\f  $20,000 and $100,000.3 Thus, like the defendant in Stellabotte,\n\n  Trujillo is entitled to the benefit of the amendment. As a result, we\n\n  vacate the sentence for the theft conviction and remand for the\n\n  conviction to be entered as a class 4 felony.\n\n\u00b6 77   The partial dissent looks to several statutory provisions in\n\n  support of its conclusion that Trujillo is not entitled to the benefit of\n\n  the amendatory legislation. First, the partial dissent cites section\n\n  2-4-202, which states the general presumption that statutes apply\n\n  prospectively. However, as the division noted in Stellabotte, section\n\n  18-1-410 is a specific exception to the general rule expressed in\n\n  section 2-4-202. Stellabotte, \u00b6 47 n.4, ___ P.3d at ___ n.4. We\n\n  agree with that analysis. Thus, the general presumption that\n\n  statutes apply prospectively does not apply here where Trujillo\n\n  seeks the benefit of a \u201csignificant change in the law, . . . allowing in\n\n\n\n\n  3 Trujillo asserts that the theft was between $20,000 and $100,000\n  based on testimony from trial. The People do not contest the value\n  of the stolen property in this case. We therefore assume that\n  Trujillo\u2019s offense properly fell within the value range set forth in\n  section 18-4-401(2)(h), C.R.S. 2017.\n\n                                     30\n\f  the interests of justice retroactive application of the changed legal\n\n  standard.\u201d4 \u00a7 18-1-410(1)(f)(I).\n\n\u00b6 78   The partial dissent also invokes section 2-4-303, C.R.S. 2017,\n\n  in support of its conclusion. Section 2-4-303 states:\n\n             The repeal, revision, amendment, or\n             consolidation of any statute or part of a statute\n             or section or part of a section of any statute\n             shall not have the effect to release, extinguish,\n             alter, modify, or change in whole or in part any\n             penalty, forfeiture, or liability, either civil or\n             criminal, which shall have been incurred\n             under such statute, unless the repealing,\n             revising, amending, or consolidating act so\n             expressly provides.\n\n\u00b6 79   However, the supreme court has noted that the \u201cgeneral\n\n  saving\u201d provision codified in this statute is not applicable to\n\n  criminal cases; instead, the court noted in dictum that it \u201chas\n\n\n  4 The partial dissent also asserts that section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I),\n  C.R.S. 2017, does not provide any relief to Trujillo because that\n  provision requires that \u201cthere has been significant change in the\n  law, applied to the [defendant\u2019s] conviction or sentence.\u201d The\n  partial dissent asserts that the phrase \u201capplied to\u201d requires that the\n  legislation expressly state that it applies retroactively. We disagree\n  with that interpretation, and believe that our view finds authority in\n  supreme court case law. See People v. Thomas, 185 Colo. 395, 397,\n  525 P.2d 1136, 1137 (1974) (noting that \u201c[t]he legislature intended\n  the changed legal standards to apply wherever constitutionally\n  permissible\u201d but making no mention of whether the amendatory\n  legislation reclassifying attempted second degree burglary explicitly\n  stated that it applied retroactively).\n\n                                     31\n\f  consistently adhered to the principle . . . that a defendant is entitled\n\n  to the benefits of amendatory legislation when relief is sought before\n\n  finality has attached to the judgment of conviction.\u201d Noe v. Dolan,\n\n  197 Colo. 32, 36 n.3, 589 P.2d 483, 486 n.3 (1979).\n\n\u00b6 80   In People v. Boyd, a division of the court of appeals concluded\n\n  that section 2-4-303 did not prevent the retroactive effect of an\n\n  amendatory constitutional provision. 2015 COA 109, \u00b6 27, 395\n\n  P.3d 1128, 1134, aff\u2019d, 2017 CO 2, 387 P.3d 755.5 The division\n\n  noted the supreme court\u2019s language in Noe. Id. at \u00b6 28, 395 P.3d at\n\n  1134. To the extent that other supreme court cases included\n\n  contrary statements, the Boyd division concluded that such\n\n  statements were dicta and that the supreme court had not\n\n  overruled or disapproved of either Noe or People v. Thomas, 185\n\n  Colo. 395, 398, 525 P.2d 1136, 1138 (1974) (holding that\n\n  \u201camendatory legislation mitigating the penalties for crimes should\n\n  be applied to any case which has not received final judgment\u201d).\n\n\n\n  5 The supreme court in Boyd affirmed the Court of Appeals decision\n  on different grounds, concluding that the marijuana criminal\n  offense statute had been rendered inoperative by Amendment 64.\n  Neither the majority nor the dissent in Boyd cited section 2-4-303,\n  C.R.S. 2017.\n\n                                    32\n\f  Boyd, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 395 P.3d at 1134-35. Finally, the Boyd division\n\n  concluded that section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I) controls over section 2-4-\n\n  303 because the former sets forth a specific exception to the latter,\n\n  which codifies a \u201cgeneral rule[] of construction regarding\n\n  prospective effect for amendatory legislation.\u201d Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, 395\n\n  P.3d at 1135. We agree with the Boyd division\u2019s analysis and\n\n  therefore do not perceive section 2-4-303 as a bar to the relief\n\n  Trujillo seeks.\n\n\u00b6 81   In making its statutory arguments, the partial dissent relies\n\n  on the plain meaning of both section 2-4-303 and section 18-1-\n\n  410(1)(f)(I). However, as discussed, the supreme court has not\n\n  given either provision its plain meaning. Despite express reference\n\n  in section 2-4-303 to civil and criminal penalties, the supreme court\n\n  has indicated that the provision does not apply to criminal cases.\n\n  Noe, 197 Colo. at 36 n.3, 589 P.2d at 486 n.3. Similarly, while\n\n  section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I) by its express terms applies to defendants\n\n  seeking postconviction relief, the supreme court has held that the\n\n  statute also extends to defendants seeking relief on direct appeal.\n\n  Thornton, 187 Colo. at 203, 529 P.2d at 628. In light of the\n\n\n\n\n                                    33\n\f  supreme court\u2019s interpretation of these statutes, we cannot give\n\n  them the meanings that the partial dissent ascribes to them.\n\n\u00b6 82   Finally, the partial dissent also relies on Riley v. People, in\n\n  which the supreme court noted that it has \u201cemphasized that a\n\n  defendant is not entitled to the ameliorative effects of amendatory\n\n  legislation if the General Assembly has not clearly indicated its\n\n  intent to require such retroactive application.\u201d 828 P.2d 254, 258\n\n  (Colo. 1992). However, we do not consider this statement to have\n\n  the controlling effect the partial dissent gives it. In Riley, the\n\n  defendant committed a crime in April 1988 and sought relief under\n\n  two sentencing provisions that expressly stated they applied to acts\n\n  \u201ccommitted on or after\u201d July 1, 1988. Id. at 255-56. The Riley\n\n  court held the defendant there was not entitled to relief because\n\n  applying the statutes retroactively would require the court to ignore\n\n  the \u201cclear legislative determination\u201d that the amended sentencing\n\n  provisions would apply only to acts after that date. Id. at 257.\n\n\u00b6 83   Thus, Riley is readily distinguishable from the present case,\n\n  where the amendments to the theft statute do not expressly provide\n\n  an effective date, and the language relied on by the partial dissent is\n\n  dicta. Accord McCoy, 764 P.2d at 1174 (noting that, where\n\n\n                                     34\n\f  legislation expressly stated it applied to acts committed on or after\n\n  its effective date, a \u201cdefendant does not receive any ameliorative\n\n  benefit\u201d because \u201cretroactive application of the amendatory\n\n  legislation is clearly not intended by its own terms\u201d); People v.\n\n  Macias, 631 P.2d 584, 587 (Colo. 1981) (same).\n\n\u00b6 84   Thus, we conclude, in accordance with Stellabotte, that Trujillo\n\n  should receive the benefit of the amendment to the theft statute\n\n  reclassifying theft between $20,000 and $100,000 as a class 4\n\n  felony. See Stellabotte, \u00b6 40, ___ P.3d at ___.\n\n                               VIII. Conclusion\n\n\u00b6 85   Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed. The\n\n  sentence is affirmed in part and vacated in part, and the case is\n\n  remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views\n\n  expressed in this opinion.\n\n       JUDGE RICHMAN concurs.\n\n       JUDGE FURMAN concurs in part and dissents in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                     35\n\f          JUDGE FURMAN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\u00b6 86      I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion only as to the\n\n  effect of the 2013 amendments to the theft statute. I conclude that\n\n  the 2013 amendments to the theft statute do not apply retroactively\n\n  to Trujillo\u2019s case. I reach this conclusion for several reasons.\n\n\u00b6 87      First, the General Assembly has made it clear that a \u201cstatute is\n\n  presumed to be prospective in its operation.\u201d \u00a7 2-4-202, C.R.S.\n\n  2017. The 2013 amendments to the theft statute are silent as to\n\n  whether they apply prospectively or retroactively. Therefore, I\n\n  presume that the 2013 amendments are prospective in operation\n\n  and do not apply to Trujillo\u2019s offense, which occurred before 2013.\n\n  See id.\n\n\u00b6 88      Second, an amendment to a criminal statute does not change\n\n  the penalty for crimes already committed under the statute unless\n\n  the amendatory legislation expressly provides for such a change.\n\n  See \u00a7 2-4-303, C.R.S. 2017. Section 2-4-303 provides, in relevant\n\n  part:\n\n               The . . . amendment . . . of any statute or part\n               of a statute . . . shall not have the effect to\n               release, extinguish, alter, modify, or change in\n               whole or in part any penalty, forfeiture, or\n               liability, either civil or criminal, which shall\n\n\n                                      36\n\f             have been incurred under such statute, unless\n             the . . . amending . . . act so expressly\n             provides, and such statute or part of a statute\n             . . . so . . . amended . . . shall be treated and\n             held as still remaining in force for the purpose\n             of sustaining any and all proper actions, suits,\n             proceedings, and prosecutions, criminal as\n             well as civil, for the enforcement of such\n             penalty, forfeiture, or liability, as well as for\n             the purpose of sustaining any judgment,\n             decree, or order which can or may be rendered,\n             entered, or made in such actions, suits,\n             proceedings, or prosecutions imposing,\n             inflicting, or declaring such penalty, forfeiture,\n             or liability.\n\n  Because the 2013 amendments to the theft statute do not expressly\n\n  provide that they apply retroactively, and Trujillo committed his\n\n  crime before 2013, he is liable for theft as it was defined when he\n\n  committed the offense. See id.\n\n\u00b6 89   Third, in Riley v. People, 828 P.2d 254, 258 (Colo. 1992), our\n\n  supreme court \u201cemphasized that a defendant is not entitled to the\n\n  ameliorative effects of amendatory legislation if the General\n\n  Assembly has not clearly indicated its intent to require such\n\n  retroactive application.\u201d Id. I consider this statement by the\n\n  supreme court about its own jurisprudence on this issue to be\n\n  controlling.\n\n\n\n\n                                    37\n\f\u00b6 90   Fourth, section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I), C.R.S. 2017, does not allow\n\n  Trujillo, on direct appeal, to seek retroactive application of the 2013\n\n  amendments to his case. Section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I) allows a\n\n  defendant to seek retroactive application of a \u201csignificant change in\n\n  the law, applied to\u201d a defendant\u2019s \u201cconviction or sentence.\u201d I believe\n\n  that the phrase \u201capplied to\u201d reflects the General Assembly\u2019s intent\n\n  that, for amendatory legislation to apply retroactively to a\n\n  defendant\u2019s conviction or sentence, the legislation must state that it\n\n  applies retroactively. Thus, because, as noted, the 2013\n\n  amendments do not state that they apply retroactively to Trujillo\u2019s\n\n  conviction and sentence, he may not seek retroactive application\n\n  under section 18-1-410(1)(f)(I).\n\n\u00b6 91   Finally, and with all due respect, I decline to follow People v.\n\n  Stellabotte, 2016 COA 106 (cert. granted Feb. 6, 2017). Indeed, I\n\n  agree with Judge Dailey\u2019s dissent in Stellabotte. See id. at \u00b6\u00b6 62-70\n\n  (Dailey, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n\n\n\n                                     38\n\f", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "FreeLaw"}}

Vi g\u00e5r konkret inn i hvert tilfelle og ser gjennom dokumentene vi har.\n\nI dommen fra lagmannsretten, som legges til grunn for tilbakekallelsen av f\u00f8rerretten, st\u00e5r det at \u00e9n overtredelse i \u00e5ret ikke er tilstrekkelig for \u00e5 tibakekallelse. \u00abTo kan v\u00e6re det men formuleringen flere tyder p\u00e5 at det m\u00e5 v\u00e6re minst tre overtredelser i l\u00f8pet av siste par \u00e5r\u00bb, st\u00e5r det i dommernes tolkning av Vegtrafikkloven.\n\nTar ikke hensyn til lovlighet\n\nF\u00f8r ungdommene mistet lappen, fikk de et forh\u00e5ndsvarsel fra Forvaltningsenheten. Deretter fikk de 14 dager p\u00e5 seg med \u00e5 komme med informasjon de mener er relevant for saken.\n\n\u2014 Det er mange som kommer med uttalelser. Det inng\u00e5r som en del av sakens dokumenter, og blir en del av helhetsvurderingen, sier F\u00fcrstenberg, som igjen understreker at det gj\u00f8res en skj\u00f8nnsmessig vurdering i hvert tilfelle, og at hun uttaler seg p\u00e5 generelt grunnlag.\n\nForvaltningsenheten tar ikke hensyn til lovligheten av rusmiddelet som benyttes, n\u00e5r det gjelder vurderingen av edruelighet.\n\n\u2014 Vi ser p\u00e5 en konkret helhetsvurdering av ruseffekten, sier F\u00fcrstenberg.\n\nAlkohol = narkotika\n\nI prinsippet kan dermed alkoholbruk og narkotikabruk dermed behandles likt med tanke p\u00e5 om man f\u00e5r beholde f\u00f8rerkortet.\n\n\u2014 Det vi m\u00e5 vurdere er om bruken tilsier en \u00f8kt risiko i trafikken.\n\nFor \u00e5 f\u00e5 sertifikatet tilbake, m\u00e5 ungdommene vise til dokumentert rusfrihet i ett \u00e5r.\n\n\u2014 Det blir en konkret vurdering i hvert tilfelle, men de m\u00e5 sannsynliggj\u00f8re edruelighet. Det er opp til personen selv og skaffe bevis for dette, gjerne fra lege, sier hun.\n\n\u00d8kning i f\u00f8rerkortbeslag\n\nFra 1. januar til 5. august i \u00e5r, har politiet i Hordaland fattet 644 vedtak om tilbakekallelse av f\u00f8rerretten.\n\n550 av disse vedtakene kommer som f\u00f8lge av vedtak fattet av fylkesmannen, mens 94 av dem er p\u00e5 bakgrunn av saker politiet selv har initiert.\n\nSamme periode i fjor, var det totalt 578 vedtak, og bare 34 av dem kom p\u00e5 bakgrunn av saker politiet selv initierte.\n\n\u2014 Vi ser at antallet egeninitierte saker g\u00e5r opp etter at vi innf\u00f8rte den nye metodikken. Det er et mer str\u00f8mlinjeformet system, som vi er glade for, sier Ane Kvaal, politiinspekt\u00f8r og leder for forvaltningsenheten i Hordaland-politiet.\n\nNytt prosjekt\n\nDet som har skjedd i mellomtiden, er nemlig at politiet har implementert prosjektet Forebygging gjennom forvaltning. Det er i praksis en ny struktur for \u00e5 fange opp meldinger fra politiets egne ansatte om personer hvor det er grunn til \u00e5 tro at vedkommende ikke lenger fyller vilk\u00e5rene for \u00e5 inneha en tillatelse fra politiet.\n\nKvaal er forsiktig med \u00e5 tilskrive det nye prosjektet all \u00e6ren for at antallet vedtak som f\u00f8lge av egeninitierte saker g\u00e5r opp.\n\n\u2014 \u00d8kningen kan jo skyldes at politiet har blitt flinkere til p\u00e5 melde fra, eller at det finnes flere personer som ikke burde ha f\u00f8rerkort. Men det er vanskelig med sikkerhet \u00e5 si hva sammenhengen er.\n\nVet du noe om saken?

{"text": "Introduction {#sec1-1}\n============\n\nInfliximab (IFX), a chimeric anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody, is effective in inducing and maintaining remission in a considerable proportion of IBD patients refractory to any other treatments \\[[@ref1],[@ref2]\\]. However, 8-12% of adult and/or pediatric patients fail to respond to the induction regimen (known as primary non responders) and approximately 40% of patients who respond initially and achieve clinical remission inevitably lose response over time\\[[@ref3],[@ref7]\\]. Lack of response to IFX is a stable trait and suggests that the differences in response might be in part genetically determined. Considering the high cost and safety profile of this drug, genetic targeting of patients responding to this therapy is certainly of great interest \\[[@ref8]\\]. So far, limited candidate gene association studies with response to IFX have been reported \\[[@ref9]-[@ref11]\\]. Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in paediatric IBD patients has revealed that the 21q22.2/BRWDI loci were associated with primary non response \\[[@ref12]\\]. Furthermore, although TNFa gene is of great interest as a candidate gene for pharmacogenetic approaches few studies have been performed to date and some have led to contradictory results \\[[@ref10],[@ref11],[@ref13]-[@ref15]\\].\n\nAll anti-TNF agents share an IgG1 Fc fragment, but the contribution of the Fc portion to the response to treatment among currently used TNF blockers remains unknown. Receptors for IgG-Fc portion (FcR) are important regulatory molecules of inflammatory responses. FcR polymorphisms alter receptor function by enhancing or diminishing the affinity for immunoglobulins \\[[@ref16]\\]. Three major classes of FcR that are capable of binding IgG antibodies are recognised: Fc\u03b3R\u0399 (CD64), Fc\u03b3R\u0399\u0399 (CD32), and Fc\u03b3R\u0399\u0399\u0399 (CD16). Fc\u03b3R\u0399\u0399 and Fc\u03b3R\u0399\u0399\u0399 have multiple isoforms (Fc\u03b3R\u0399\u0399\u0399A/C and B; Fc\u03b3R\u0399\u0399\u0399A and B) \\[[@ref16]\\]. The most frequent polymorphism of *Fc\u03b3R\u0399\u0399\u0399A* is a point mutation affecting amino acids in codon 158 in the extracellular domain. This results in either a valine (V158) or a phenylalanine (F158) at this position. Recently, it has been reported that CD patients with *Fc\u03b3R\u0399\u0399\u0399A* -158V/V genotype had a better biological and possibly better clinical response to IFX \\[[@ref17]\\]. However, further studies did not confirm this observation \\[[@ref18]\\].\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess whether the *TNF* and/ or *Fc\u03b3R\u0399\u0399\u0399A* gene polymorphisms are genetic predictors of response to IFX, in a cohort of Greek patients with adult or paediatric onset of CD.\n\nPatients - Methods {#sec1-2}\n==================\n\nPatients {#sec2-1}\n--------\n\nWe enrolled 106 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed CD attending the outpatient IBD Clinic at the 1^st^ Department of Gastroenterology, \"Evangelismos\" Hospital (79 adults) or the 1^st^ Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Athens \"Aghia Sophia\"(27 children). The diagnosis of CD was based on standard clinical, endoscopic, radiological, and histological criteria \\[[@ref1],[@ref19]\\]. Eligible patients should have inflammatory (luminal) disease and be naive to IFX.\n\nIFX was administered intravenously at a dose of 5mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6 and then every 8 weeks. Clinical and serological responses were assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) \\[[@ref20]\\] and the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), respectively, at baseline (before the 1st infusion of IFX), the day before each subsequent IFX infusion and after 12 weeks of treatment. Ileocolonoscopy was performed by a single endoscopist (GJM) at baseline and after 12-20 weeks of therapy to assess mucosal healing. Any changes in endoscopic appearance compared to baseline endoscopy were classified in four categories \\[[@ref21],[@ref22]\\] \\[[Table 1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"}\\]. Patients were classified in accordance to response to IFX therapy as shown in [table 2](#T2){ref-type=\"table\"}. The ethical committee of the participating hospitals approved the study. Research was carried out according to Helsinki Convention (1975) and written inform consent was obtained in advance from each patient.\n\n###### \n\nGrading of endoscopic mucosal lesions \\[[@ref21],[@ref22]\\]\n\n![](AnnGastroenterol-24-35-g001)\n\n###### \n\nClassification of the study population due to response to infliximab therapy\n\n![](AnnGastroenterol-24-35-g002)\n\nGenotyping {#sec2-2}\n----------\n\nGenomic DNA from whole blood containing EDTA was extracted using standard techniques (NucleoSpin Blood kit, Macherey-Nagel, Germany). All polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were run under conditions previously described \\[[@ref23]\\]. Primer sequences for the gene polymorphism at --308 were forward 5\u2032-GGG ACA CAC AAG CAT CAA GG-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-GGG ACA CAC AAG CAT CAA GG-3\u2032, for the polymorphism at \u2212238 forward 5\u2032-ATC TGG AGG AAG CGG TAG TG-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-AGA AGA CCC CCC TCG GAA CC-3\u2032. The PCR products were digested at 37 \u00b0C with NcoI to detect the SNP in the \u2212308 gene allele and MspI to detect the polymorphism of the \u2212238 nucleotide. The -857 C/T polymorphism was analyzed by allele-specific PCR method24 using the primers TNF857-C: 5\u2032-aag gat aag ggc tca gag ag-3\u2032, TNF857-N: 5\u2032-cta cat ggc cct gtc ttc g-3\u2032 and TNF857-M: 5\u2032-t cta cat ggc cct gtc ttc a-3\u2032. The --158V/F polymorphism of Fc\u03b3R\u0399\u0399\u0399A gene was detected as described by Leppers-van de Straat et al \\[[@ref25]\\] using the primers 5\u2032-CTG AAG ACA CAT TTT TACT CC CAA (A/C)-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TCC AAA AGC CAC ACT CAA AGA C-3\u2032. The PCR products were then subjected to 3% agarose-gel electrophoresis. \"No target\" controls were included in each PCR batch to ensure that reagents had not been contaminated.\n\nStatistical Analysis {#sec2-3}\n--------------------\n\nGenotype frequencies were compared with the chi-square with Yate's correction using S-Plus (v. 6.2Insightful, Seattle, WA). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained with GraphPad (v. 3.00, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The p values are all two-sided. Correction for multiple testing was not applied in this study. *P* values of \\< 0.05 were considered to be significant.\n\nResults {#sec1-3}\n=======\n\nPatient demographic and clinical characteristics are given in [Table 3](#T3){ref-type=\"table\"}. There were 68 (64.15%) complete responders, 25 (23.58%) partial responders and 13 (12.26%) non responders to IFX in this study. There were no statistical differences in the mean age, gender, disease duration, location and behavior and smoking habits between complete or partial responders and primary non-responders. There was no disagreement between HBI scores and serum CRP levels. Although, the post-treatment CRP levels were significantly lower in complete responders compared to partial and non-responders, the decrease in CRP levels did not differ significantly between the three groups. Post-treatment CRP levels and mean HBI score were significantly lower in complete responders compared to pre-treatment values in contrast to partial and/or non-responders where the CRP levels and the mean HBI score did not differ significantly.\n\n###### \n\nDemographic, clinical and biological characteristics of the study population\n\n![](AnnGastroenterol-24-35-g003)\n\nThe -238 G/A, -308 G/A, and -857 C/T polymorphisms of the TNF gene and the -158 V/F polymorphism in the *Fc\u03b3R\u0399\u0399\u0399A* gene were successfully determined in all subjects. The genotype distribution in complete, partial and non-responders were presented in [Table 4](#T4){ref-type=\"table\"}. No significant difference was observed for the polymorphism tested. In addition, although there may be genetic differences in early (paediatric)-onset and late (adult)-onset CD we were unable to detect any such differences although the number of paediatric patients included in the current study did not allow firm conclusions.\n\n###### \n\nGenotype frequency in complete responders, partial responders and non responders\n\n![](AnnGastroenterol-24-35-g004)\n\nIn the present study, we could not correlate the decrease in serum CRP levels with the genotypes tested in any particular group of patients since in most of the cases serum CRP levels dropped by more than 25% after 12 weeks of treatment. However, no significant decrease in CRP was observed between the TNF genotypes tested. Regarding the -158 V/F polymorphism in the *Fc\u03b3R\u0399\u0399\u0399A* gene, the relative decrease in serum CRP levels was greatest in VV homozygotes (78.15 \u00b1 33.68%) and lowest in FF homozygotes (69.84 \u00b1 28.7%) but this difference was not significant. Due to the small number of cases we did not stratify the genotype frequencies according to age.\n\nDiscussion {#sec1-4}\n==========\n\nThe mechanism of IFX action in IBD seems to be multifactorial and the response to IFX is a complex phenomenon influenced by several parameters \\[[@ref1]\\]. Interestingly, a certain proportion of patients do not respond to IFX at all whereas a significant proportion will lose response over time \\[[@ref3]-[@ref7]\\]. This is the first Greek study aiming at identifying any significant associationbetween the -238 G/A, -308 G/A, and -857 C/T polymorphisms in the promoter region of the TNF gene and the -158V/F polymorphism in *Fc\u03b3R\u0399\u0399\u0399A* gene and response to IFX in a cohort of adult and paediatric patients with CD and it was negative.\n\nEfficacy of IFX was assessed by clinical, serological and endoscopic parameters. Clinical response to IFX was evaluated using the HBI, which has been used in many clinical trials, is simple to use and has shown good correlation with the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \\[[@ref26]\\]. Serological evaluation of response to IFX was based on changes in serum levels of CRP, which has shown a good correlation with clinical activity and to a certain degree with endoscopic activity of CD \\[[@ref27]\\]. Finally, endoscopic activity of disease was assessed before and after IFX therapy using a simple description of healing of ulcerative and non ulcerative lesions \\[[Table 1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"}\\] as has been previously described \\[[@ref21],[@ref22]\\]. Endoscopic healing was assessed after 12-20 weeks of IFX treatment. It is conceivable that 12 weeks may be early to assess mucosal healing induced by biologic therapies \\[[@ref27]\\] but the vast majority of patients underwent endoscopy at least 16 weeks after initiation of IFX therapy (average time 17.6 weeks) and therefore it is unlikely that we have not obtained an objective view of the intestinal mucosal at follow up ileocolonoscopy.\n\nRegarding the *TNF* genotypes, our results are in agreement with Louis et al \\[[@ref11]\\] who did not find any significant difference between response groups when genotyped CD patients for the TNF -308G/A polymorphism and compared response rates after IFX treatment. The same results were reported by Mascheretti et al \\[[@ref10]\\] and Dideberg et al \\[[@ref13]\\]. Moreover, our results are in agreement with Tomita et al \\[[@ref28]\\] who reported no significant difference on *TNFa*, *FcgammaRIIA* and *FcgammaRIIIA* between responders and non responders 8 weeks after IFX treatment as well as with results of ACCENT I study where the relative decrease in serum CRP levels after IFX treatment was greatest in -158 VV homozygotes and lowest in FF homozygotes \\[[@ref18]\\]. In contrast, Louis et al \\[[@ref17]\\] observed a significant association between the -158V/F polymorphism in *Fc\u03b3R\u0399\u0399\u0399A* and both the proportion of patients who had a drop in serum CRP levels after IFX treatment and the magnitude in decrease of serum CRP levels. This may account for the relatively small population of patients in our study, genetic differences in the studied populations and/or methodological differences between studies.\n\nAlthough it would be useful to genetically differentiate 'responders' from 'non-responders', there are not enough data on TNF polymorphisms in IBD and often only selected polymorphisms are genotyped. Small studies have shown possible associations between poor response to IFX and increasing mucosal levels of activated NF-kappaB, homozygosity for the polymorphism in exon 6 of TNFR2 (genotype Arg196Arg), positivity for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and with the presence of increased numbers of activated lamina propia mononuclear cells producing interferon-gamma and TNFa \\[[@ref29]\\].\n\nIn conclusion, our study did not detect any associations between three TNF\u03b1 gene polymorphisms or the -158 V/F polymorphism in the *Fc\u03b3R\u0399\u0399\u0399A* gene and response to IFX in CD. However, in view of discrepant results in the literature large-scale pharmacogenetic studies in different populations, with similar baseline disease phenotypes and treatment protocols are needed to adequately estimate associations between genetic polymorphisms and treatment outcomes.\n\nConflict of interest: None\n\n^a^Evangelismos Hospital, ^b^Laboratory of Biology, School of Medicine, ^c^1^st^ Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Athens, Greece\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "PubMed Central"}}

{"text": "The two classes `KinesisRecorder` and `KinesisFirehoseRecorder` allow you to interface with Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream analytics data for real-time processing.\n\n## What is Amazon Kinesis Data Streams?\n\n[Amazon Kinesis Data Streams](http://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) is a fully managed service for real-time processing of streaming data at massive scale. Amazon Kinesis can collect and process hundreds of terabytes of data per hour from hundreds of thousands of sources, so you can write applications that process information in real-time. With Amazon Kinesis applications, you can build real-time dashboards, capture exceptions and generate alerts, drive recommendations, and make other real-time business or operational decisions. You can also easily send data to other services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Redshift.\n\nThe Kinesis Data Streams `KinesisRecorder` client lets you store your Kinesis requests on disk and then send them all at once using the [PutRecords](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecords.html) API call of Kinesis. This is useful because many mobile applications that use Kinesis Data Streams will create multiple requests per second. Sending an individual request under `PutRecord` action could adversely impact battery life. Moreover, the requests could be lost if the device goes offline. Thus, using the high-level Kinesis Data Streams client for batching can preserve both battery life and data.\n\n## What is Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose?\n\n[Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](http://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/firehose/) is a fully managed service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Redshift. With Kinesis Data Firehose, you do not need to write any applications or manage any resources. You configure your data producers to send data to Firehose and it automatically delivers the data to the destination that you specified.\n\nThe Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose `KinesisFirehoseRecorder` client lets you store your Kinesis Data Firehose requests on disk and then send them using the [PutRecordBatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecordBatch.html) API call of Kinesis Data Firehose.\n\nFor more information about Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, see [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/what-is-this-service.html).\n\n## Integrating Amazon Kinesis\n\nSet up AWS Mobile SDK components by including the following libraries in your `app/build.gradle` dependencies list.\n\n```groovy\ndependencies {\n  implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-kinesis:2.15.+'\n  implementation ('com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-mobile-client:2.15.+@aar') { transitive = true }\n}\n```\n\n* `aws-android-sdk-kinesis` library enables sending analytics to Amazon Kinesis.\n* `aws-android-sdk-mobile-client` library gives access to the AWS credentials provider and configurations.\n\nAdd the following imports to the main activity of your app.\n\n```java\nimport com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.kinesis.kinesisrecorder.*;\nimport com.amazonaws.mobile.client.AWSMobileClient;\nimport com.amazonaws.regions.Regions;\n```\n\nTo use Kinesis Data Streams in an application, you must set the correct permissions. The following IAM policy allows the user to submit records to a specific data stream, which is identified by [ARN](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Statement\": [{\n        \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n        \"Action\": \"kinesis:PutRecords\",\n        \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:kinesis:us-west-2:111122223333:stream/mystream\"\n    }]\n}\n```\n\nThe following IAM policy allows the user to submit records to a specific  Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Statement\": [{\n        \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n        \"Action\": \"firehose:PutRecordBatch\",\n        \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:firehose:us-west-2:111122223333:deliverystream/mystream\"\n    }]\n}\n```\n\nThis policy should be applied to roles assigned to the Amazon Cognito identity pool, but you need to replace the `Resource` value with the correct ARN for your Amazon Kinesis or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose stream. You can apply policies at the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/). To learn more about IAM policies, see [Using IAM](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_Introduction.html).\n\nTo learn more about Amazon Kinesis Data Streams policies, see [Controlling Access to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Resources with IAM](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-iam.html).\n\nTo learn more about Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose policies, see [Controlling Access with Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/controlling-access.html).\n\n## Working with the API\n\nYou can use `AWSMobileClient` to setup the Cognito credentials that are required to authenticate your requests with Amazon Kinesis.\n\n```java\nAWSMobileClient.getInstance().initialize(getApplicationContext(), new Callback<UserStateDetails>() {\n        @Override\n        public void onResult(UserStateDetails userStateDetails) {\n            Log.i(\"INIT\", userStateDetails.getUserState().toString());\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void onError(Exception e) {\n            Log.e(\"INIT\", \"Initialization error.\", e);\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\nOnce you have credentials, you can use `KinesisRecorder` with Amazon Kinesis. The following snippet creates a directory and instantiates the `KinesisRecorder` client: \n\n```java\nString kinesisDirectory = \"YOUR_UNIQUE_DIRECTORY\";\nKinesisRecorder recorder = new KinesisRecorder(\n    myActivity.getDir(kinesisDirectory, 0),\n    Regions.<YOUR-AWS-REGION>,\n    AWSMobileClient.getInstance()\n);\n\n// KinesisRecorder uses synchronous calls, so you shouldn't call KinesisRecorder methods on the main thread.\n```\n\nTo use `KinesisFirehoseRecorder`, you need to pass the object in a directory where streaming data is saved. We recommend you use an app private directory because the data is not encrypted.\n\n```java\nKinesisFirehoseRecorder firehoseRecorder = new KinesisFirehoseRecorder(\n    context.getCachedDir(), \n    Regions.<YOUR-AWS-REGION>,\n    AWSMobileClient.getInstance());\n```\n\nConfigure Kinesis:\n\nYou can configure `KinesisRecorder` or `KinesisFirehoseRecorder` through their properties:\n\nYou can configure the maximum allowed storage via the `withMaxStorageSize()` method of `KinesisRecorderConfig`.\n\nYou can retrieve the same information by getting the `KinesisRecorderConfig` object for the recorder and calling `getMaxStorageSize():`\n\n```java\nKinesisRecorderConfig kinesisRecorderConfig = recorder.getKinesisRecorderConfig();\nLong maxStorageSize = kinesisRecorderConfig.getMaxStorageSize();\n// Do something with maxStorageSize\n```\n\nTo check the number of bytes currently stored in the directory passed in to the `KinesisRecorder` constructor, call `getDiskBytesUsed()`:\n\n```java\nLong bytesUsed = recorder.getDiskBytesUsed();\n// Do something with bytesUsed\n```\n\nTo see how much space the `KinesisRecorder` client is allowed to use, you can call `getDiskByteLimit()`.\n\n```java\nLong byteLimit = recorder.getDiskByteLimit();\n// Do something with byteLimit\n```\n\nWith `KinesisRecorder` created and configured, you can use `saveRecord()` to save records and then send them in a batch.\n\n```java\nrecorder.saveRecord(\n\t\"MyData\".getBytes(),\n\t\"MyStreamName\");\nrecorder.submitAllRecords();\n```\n\nFor the `saveRecord()` request above to work, you would have to have created a stream named `MyStreamName`. You can create new streams in the [Amazon Kinesis console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesis).\n\nIf `submitAllRecords()` is called while the app is online, requests will be sent and removed from the disk. If `submitAllRecords()` is called while the app is offline, requests will be kept on disk until `submitAllRecords()` is called while online. This applies even if you lose your internet connection midway through a submit. So if you save ten requests, call `submitAllRecords()`, send five, and then lose the Internet connection, you have five requests left on disk. These remaining five will be sent the next time `submitAllRecords()` is invoked online.\n\nHere is a similar snippet for Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose:\n\n```java\n// Start to save data, either a String or a byte array\nfirehoseRecorder.saveRecord(\"Hello world!\\n\");\nfirehoseRecorder.saveRecord(\"Streaming data to Amazon S3 via Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is easy.\\n\");\n\n// Send previously saved data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose\n// Note: submitAllRecords() makes network calls, so wrap it in an AsyncTask.\nnew AsyncTask<Void, Void, Void>() {\n   @Override\n   protected Void doInBackground(Void... v) {\n       try {\n           firehoseRecorder.submitAllRecords();\n       } catch (AmazonClientException ace) {\n           // handle error\n       }\n   }\n}.execute();\n```\n\nTo learn more about working with Kinesis Data Streams, see the [Amazon Kinesis Data Streams resources](http://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/developer-resources/).\n\nTo learn more about the Kinesis Data Streams classes, see the [class reference for KinesisRecorder](https://aws-amplify.github.io/aws-sdk-android/docs/reference/com/amazonaws/mobileconnectors/kinesis/kinesisrecorder/KinesisRecorder.html).\n\nTo learn more about the Kinesis Data Firehose classes, see the [class reference for KinesisFirehoseRecorder](https://aws-amplify.github.io/aws-sdk-android/docs/reference/com/amazonaws/mobileconnectors/kinesis/kinesisrecorder/KinesisFirehoseRecorder.html).\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Github"}}

{"text": "Retrieval of blade implants with piezosurgery: two clinical cases.\nIn this work an ultrasound device was used to perform an ostectomy for the removal of blade implants in order to save as much bone tissue as possible, so that root form implants might later be inserted. Two patients underwent surgery for the removal of two blade implants (one maxillary, the other mandibular) that were no longer functional. The peri-implant ostectomy was carried out with a piezoelectric surgery device. The instrument demonstrated to be effective and precise during ostectomy, providing an extremely thin cutting line. During the course of the operation and at controls after 7 and 30 days, patients did not show any relevant complications and both still had sufficient alveolar bone to be treated with root form implants. The piezosurgery device proved to be an effective instrument in interventions requiring a significant saving of bone tissue, extreme precision in cutting, and respect of soft tissues.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "PubMed Abstracts"}}
{"text": "Writing my last blog post really got me thinking about that guy and all the crazy things we done. The more I thought about it, the more memories came flooding back and I decided that this blog has been a little too sad/awkward so far and anyone reading must think I\u2019ve had a whole bunch of horrible experiences. It\u2019s about time I chronicled the peaks of my journey so far and this guy is definitely a peak. In fact, I almost peak myself just thinking about him.\n\nWe met in a field. I was there \u201ccamping\u201d with friends. There were no tents. Our trip basically involved trekking into a little patch of woodland on a farm outside of town and getting really drunk/high and having sex round a badly made campfire. It was surprisingly fun. I hadn\u2019t been for a few months because I had actually fallen pregnant there, made it nearly three months into the pregnancy and miscarried. The dad wanted nothing to do with me and I hadn\u2019t told my mum. So instead of facing up to the tragedy and going to hospital, I decided that going back and getting high in conception field was a better idea. I was clearly a child genius.\n\nI hated the entire night. I hadn\u2019t been around for months, I didn\u2019t feel like I belonged anymore and I secretly resented everyone around the campfire for not being a little more sensitive to my situation. I was just a little ball of anger in the corner, curled up in a giant \u201cgoth\u201d hoodie and unable to even look at the bush in which I had regretfully created life in a drunken fumble. I was starting to see this entire thing for what it really was. Irresponsible and moronic. That\u2019s when he showed up. He looked like an angel in the firelight. He was ballsy and arrogant yet he noticed right away that I wasn\u2019t right. He was the only person that night to ask me if I was ok and he was the only one I hadn\u2019t met before. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he was hardly playing the role of my saviour but there was something about him, beyond the air of arrogance, that just drew me in. I could tell that he also hated the whole \u201cdrinking in the woods\u201d scene. At one point he asked me to go home with him but I said no, having just suffered the consequences of losing the only good thing to come out of my last drunken encounter.\n\nEveryone got drunk and stripped to their pants except me. There was a lot of jumping over the fire and running around nearly naked. It was fun to watch actually. He played guitar by the fire as we got high until the sun came up and it was just us two left. The night ended with him spooning me on the muddy floor and in the morning, he left with my number and my story. He said I needed reminding of what life is really about and that I was going about it the wrong way in those muddy woods. If I\u2019m honest I expected it to end there, I was broken and he was very aware of how hot he was. I didn\u2019t see why he\u2019d bother with a girl so obviously damaged. But he did.\n\nA week later, he calls me and invites me round for pizza and beer at his flat. I don\u2019t know why I went but I did. There was something about his attitude towards life that appealed to me at that time in my life. I\u2019d just miscarried my drunken regret, I was just about to sit important exams, my friends were horrible people and I was self-harming badly. I walked into that guy\u2019s flat a broken mess and by the time we were over, I\u2019d turned my life around and discovered who I really was. One day, I\u2019ll thank him for that.\n\nAnyways, back on track with the sex part of \u201csex blog\u201d. He was a serial charmer and holy god, he was good at it. He made me dinner, we got high and he listened to me as I told him more about how I\u2019d gotten to be where I was in life. Not to mention that he was unbelievably sexy. Before long, he was helping me out of my oversized slipknot hoodie and I had forgotten entirely about my new found chastity. He kissed away all of my resistance with a style of kissing I have since adopted myself, passionate with a lot of lip but no tongue. I was mesmerised and more turned on than I\u2019d ever been before. For once, I wasn\u2019t having sex for attention, for reassurance, for control. I was driven entirely by lust and I loved it.\n\nNow, when we were at the campsite the previous week he\u2019d told me that he\u2019d always been insecure about his small penis. He genuinely seemed so down about it which really didn\u2019t match his personality at all as he oozed confidence. At the time, I was flattered that he\u2019d confided in me about it and hadn\u2019t thought much of it. However, as he knelt between my legs about to unveil his tiny penis I was suddenly filled with dread. I was terrified that if I didn\u2019t at least pretend to have the time of my life, his complex would be worsened and I didn\u2019t wanna do that to him. So as he was about to pull off his (very tight and very sexy) boxers, I braced myself for a shrivelled little thing to greet me. Now, the room was dimly lit and I\u2019d been wearing jeans so I had no idea what was about to pop out.\n\nIt turns out he\u2019d lied about his penis being tiny purely because he liked the look on girls\u2019 faces when they came face to face with what I can only describe as the most perfect penis I\u2019ve ever seen after expecting something insignificant. How deviously twisted of him. I found it hilarious, personally. It definitely tickled me pink.\n\nWhat followed was literally life-changing sex. His tongue gave me tingles in places I didn\u2019t even know could tingle and he done things with his penis that I have never been able to replicate since. It was raw, carnal and rough. I\u2019d been with dominant guys before but I\u2019d always felt like ultimately, I was in control. Not this time. He truly owned every part of me that night and I loved it. He held me down and teased me until I begged and then kept teasing. A few hours in, he\u2019d turned me from a timid and sad girl into a ferocious sex toy and I had never felt so alive. I spent that night acting purely upon selfish impulses and the desire for new sensations rather than thought and logic like usual. He was exactly what I needed to wake me up from the pit of teenage angst I\u2019d fallen into. I went home aching everywhere and grinning ear to ear. I was hooked.\n\nI was back the next day and he knew I would be. This time I thought I was ready for him, that I knew what was coming but I\u2019d soon learn that would never be the case with this one. He loved pushing boundaries and was inherently unpredictable. This time we had shower sex and he found it hilarious that I was unable to stay standing when I orgasmed. The next time he tied me up with duct tape and teased me for hours. I just kept coming back for more. Soon I started skipping school to spend time with him. We had high sex, drunk sex,, rough sex, morning sex, slow sex, half asleep sex, angry sex, and ultimately sad sex. It didn\u2019t take me long to convince my immature self that I loved this boy. He\u2019d woken me up from my sadness and I soon confused this new found happiness and emotion with love. I wanted him to myself and even then it was apparent that he was untameable.\n\nOne time I showed up at his place with fresh cuts on my legs. He was so disappointed. He\u2019d spent weeks building my confidence, teaching me to stop wearing my heart on my sleeve and now I\u2019d relapsed. This was when he really turned my life around. He took me shopping, made me try on girly clothes instead of the usual baggy black clothes I usually wore. He bought me my first lingerie corset-suspender set and my first vibrator (Hamish). He took me to his flat, dressed me up in the lingerie and went over every inch of my body telling me what he found sexy about it. He cuddled me after sex and told me about his view of life, about how I was way too young to be carrying so much bitterness and sadness around on my sleeve. How I\u2019d regret missing out on being young when I\u2019m older. Then he played his guitar and sung his own songs naked (honestly).\n\nSince that night I have never cut myself on purpose again.\n\nWe continued our whirlwind romance. He sneaked me into pubs despite both of us being underage, his charm got him served easily. I tried my first shot with him. He took me to his favourite shop \u2013 a little vintage place outside of the city centre. He taught me how to roll a joint and we\u2019d fall asleep during high sex, him still inside me. He encouraged me to help myself along during sex and I had the most powerful orgasms I\u2019d ever had doing that. I starred in my very first sex video with him. I tried anal for he first time after he tied me up with my stockings, gagged me and used my vibrator on me. I found out all of my limits with him and loved every second and every time he pushed me just a little bit further.\n\nHe pushed me to look for who I really was but despite all of the sweet and sexy things he\u2019d do for me I knew deep down he wasn\u2019t just mine. He refused to commit, he saw other girls and didn\u2019t keep in regular contact. I hated it and pushed for commitment. Then, he found out he was gonna be a dad. He\u2019d gotten some other girl pregnant. I was upset but in my stupid teenage infatuation, I stayed with him. Then I walked in on him and that other girl and that\u2019s where my last post starts.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t how I\u2019d hoped it would end but by that stage I\u2019d grown in confidence so much that I\u2019d realised that he had given me all I needed to get by on my own. He was a wild one and had no plans for the future and had a baby on the way. I had just aced all of my exams and my future was whatever I wanted it to be. Limitless.\n\nThe girl went on to have a baby boy. He now has a 4 year old son and last I heard was selling drugs and in a band. He texted me later on and asked if I wanted to have another threesome with him and the baby\u2019s mum or wanted any drugs. I said no and that\u2019s the last I ever heard of the wild boy who taught me how to push boundaries and to be proud of my own body and what I can do with it.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

Astronomers\ntell terrestrial dwellers not to sweat it too much, despite\nthe fact that solar activity is approaching an 11-year peak.\n\nTwo large sunspots moving across the surface of the sun are\nexpected to directly face the Earth soon for up to several\ndays, according to solar scientists. Such sunspots often\nherald powerful coronal mass ejections and solar flares,\nspace storms that can disrupt weather and electrical systems\non Earth.\n\nSolar flares are the largest explosions in the solar system.\nA typical one can release the energy equivalent of millions\nof 100-megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at once.\n\nHighly charged particles from large flares can overload power\ngrids and damage satellites. In 1989, one space storm knocked\nout a major power plant in Canada, leaving millions without\npower for hours.\n\nSolar activity generally waxes and wanes during an 11-year\ncycle and astronomers expect it to peak either this or next\nyear. But so far, the sun has produced only a \"disappointing\"\nlevel of fireworks, said Joseph Gurman, a solar physicist who\nanalyzes data from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory.\n\nCoronal mass ejections are much more likely to produce\neffects, Gurman said. Like flares, they send streams of highly\ncharged particles, but they also can emit a billion tons of\nplasma, or ionized gas.\n\nFortunately the Earth's magnetosphere usually bears the brunt\nof plasma particles. \"If we were exposed to them, we\nliterally would be fried,\" Gurman said.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "Pile-CC"}}

{"text": "For the Democratic Party, a pliant and friendly news media is both a blessing and a curse.\n\nOn the one hand, the corporate press's eagerness to rehabilitate Democratic officials after even the most shameful and despicable acts has made it possible for some of the party\u2019s worst actors to maintain political power with relative ease. Then again, the news media\u2019s reflexively and reliably soft coverage of left-wing lawmakers has made the chief benefactors of this cozy relationship both soft and complacent. Democratic officials and candidates have been lulled into a false sense of security, ignoring or forgetting the benefits that come with being tempered by a thorough, brutal vetting.\n\nThe downside to the corporate media\u2019s mostly hands-off approach to covering Democratically aligned lawmakers was never clearer than it was during the Feb. 19 primary debate in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who spent much of the evening having his entrails ripped out by his 2020 opponents and paraded around the stage, managed to get in one good blow against Sen. Bernie Sanders, going after the Vermont lawmaker for his conspicuous wealth.\n\n\u201cWhat a wonderful country we have,\u201d said the former mayor. \u201cThe best-known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses. What did I miss here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d an irate Sanders said, \u201cYou'll miss that I work in Washington, house one. \u201d\n\nBloomberg interjected, \u201cThat's the first problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cLive in Burlington, house two,\u201d the senator continued.\n\nThe former mayor interrupted again, \u201cThat's good.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd like thousands of other Vermonters, I do have a summer camp. Forgive me for that. Where is your home? Which tax haven do you have your home?\u201d Sanders demanded, hopelessly losing the exchange.\n\n\u201cNew York City, thank you very much,\u201d Bloomberg said to applause, \u201cand I pay all my taxes.\u201d\n\nThe most remarkable thing about the exchange is not that Sanders was so easily baited by Bloomberg into making a sloppy, blindly angry defense but that it marked the first time in the 2020 campaign season that anyone, Democrat, reporter, or debate moderator, pressed the 2020 Democratic primary front-runner to reconcile his own considerable fortune with his core message of confiscating wealth from business owners.\n\nHow did Sanders make it through nine debates without a fellow Democrat or debate moderator asking him to respond to the most obvious criticism he will face should he go up against Trump? The 2016 election was a \u201ctakers versus makers\u201d election. It is astonishing, then, that it took for a 2020 Democratic primary candidate who is not even on the ballot in Nevada or South Carolina to ask the millionaire socialist senator about his three houses. I guess that is what happens when you schedule all your primary debates with only friendly news networks.\n\nThis gets to the precise problem of the too-friendly relationship between the Democratic Party and the corporate media. It is a double-edged sword that allows terrible men to weather what should be career-ending scandals and missteps but also leads to their entire party getting lazy and soft. Not having to worry about a tough, combative press is how you get incidents such as the 2020 Democratic front-runner being totally unprepared to answer the most obvious criticism of his campaign.\n\nIf Sanders's disastrous handling of Bloomberg's no-brainer broadside is a portent of things to come, the general election meat grinder will be a straight-up bloodbath for Democrats.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}

{"text": "Da den fynske optiker Finn Juncker tog til Senegal for at v\u00e6re med til at uddele brugte briller til befolkningen, var han opfyldt af idealisme og entusiasme. Fem \u00e5r senere m\u00e5tte han sande, hvor vanskeligt det kan v\u00e6re at hj\u00e6lpe andre.\n\nFinn Juncker har et freelance-optikerfirma. Med udgangspunkt i F\u00e5borg arbejder han ogs\u00e5 i Albertslund, i Malaga og i Gr\u00f8nland, og i perioder har han arbejdet i Senegal. Det sidste for egen regning.\n\nDet afrikanske eventyr begyndte, da han s\u00e5 en annonce i bladet Optikeren, hvor man s\u00f8gte optikere til et projekt om brugte briller til befolkningen i Senegal. Projektet gik ud p\u00e5, at indsamle brugte briller i Danmark. Brillerne blev renoveret og repareret af tidligere alkoholikere og narkomaner p\u00e5 et behandlingshjem i Nyk\u00f8bing Falster og herefter sendt til Senegal.\n\nBag projektet stod en dansk sygeplejerske. Hun s\u00f8gte to optikere, en sygeplejerske mere og en medhj\u00e6lper. I 1998 rejste disse fire, inklusive Finn Juncker, til Senegal. De skulle selv betale rejsen og opholdet, og de m\u00e5tte bruge deres sommerferie p\u00e5 det.\n\n- Vi boede i lerhytter hos de lokale og sov p\u00e5 gulvet, og vores tre daglige m\u00e5ltider bestod af ris, som vi selv skulle betale for. Vi havde ogs\u00e5 udgifter til chauff\u00f8r og benzin. Vi var der knap tre uger, og vi foretog 200 synspr\u00f8ver og udleverede 150 par briller hver dag. Folk var kommet g\u00e5ende flere dagsmarcher for at f\u00e5 briller. Desv\u00e6rre kom der ogs\u00e5 mange blinde og folk med gr\u00e5 st\u00e6r, som h\u00e5bede, at vi kunne kurere dem. Det var h\u00e5rdt at v\u00e6re vidne til. Men de mange, vi kunne hj\u00e6lpe, var hele rejsen v\u00e6rd, fort\u00e6ller Finn Juncker.\n\nKort efter projektets start s\u00f8gte den ledende sygeplejerske om midler hos Danida. Omkring en halv million kr. blev bevilget til de tre \u00e5r, projektet skulle l\u00f8be. Det var nu et Danida-projekt.\n\nNogle af pengene gik til at f\u00e5 senegalesere til Danmark, hvor Finn Juncker opl\u00e6rte dem, s\u00e5 de kunne fungere som optikere hjemme og s\u00e5ledes overtage danskernes arbejde. Der gik tre \u00e5r p\u00e5 denne m\u00e5de. Finn Juncker brugte to-tre uger hvert \u00e5r af sin sommerferie p\u00e5 at arbejde som optiker i Senegal, og om vinteren opl\u00e6rte han senegalesere i Danmark. Men \u00f8konomien knirkede.\n\n- Der var et eller andet helt galt. Vi betalte alt for meget for den mad, vi spiste, dvs. ris, og alt for meget for benzin og til chauff\u00f8rens l\u00f8n. M\u00e5lt med lokale alen. F.eks. var det den danske stats kilometertakst, der blev anvendt, n\u00e5r vi skulle k\u00f8re ud og betjene befolkningen. Men brillerne blev leveret, og behovet var stort. S\u00e5 vi betalte, beretter Finn Juncker.\n\nDe var j\u00e6vnligt ude for en del ubehagelige hold-ups ved forskellige checkpoints af krigere med maskingev\u00e6rer. Omr\u00e5det var plaget af uro, og det var ikke ufarligt at bev\u00e6ge sig omkring dernede.\n\nDa projektet udl\u00f8b efter tre \u00e5r, opfordrede Finn Juncker tre optikere, han kendte som folk med hjertet p\u00e5 rette sted, til at tage med ham til Senegal i sommerferien og videref\u00f8re det p\u00e5begyndte arbejde.\n\nHan kontaktede folkene i Senegal og fortalte, at et hold p\u00e5 fire danske optikere med et l\u00e6s briller var klar til at tage af sted p\u00e5 egen h\u00e5nd. Det vil sige uden Danida-midler. Optikerne ville ikke kunne betale de samme summer til senegaleserne som hidtil for mad og transport. Da k\u00f8lnedes interessen m\u00e6rkbart hos senegaleserne, og de fire optikere kom aldrig af sted.\n\nMen Finn Juncker er gjort af st\u00e6digt stof. Han havde l\u00e6rt en gambianer at kende, som var indehaver af en brillebutik i Gambia, men som ikke var uddannet optiker. De to indgik en forretningsaftale om kompagniskab.\n\nFinn Juncker skulle l\u00e6re ham op og hj\u00e6lpe ham i gang som partner i foretagenet. Det gik ogs\u00e5 fint. Finn Juncker uddannede gambianeren i hans butik og havde medbragt en hel del kostbare m\u00e5leinstrumenter til synspr\u00f8ver.\n\nMeningen var, at gambianeren skulle k\u00f8be m\u00e5leinstrumenterne for de penge, han solgte briller for, men han ville hellere k\u00f8be biler. Da Finn Juncker forklarede ham, at han gerne ville have sine m\u00e5leinstrumenter tilbage, tilkaldte gambianeren politiet og bildte betjentene ind, at Finn Juncker havde for\u00e6ret ham instrumenterne.\n\nFinn Juncker m\u00e5tte opgive at f\u00e5 sine instrumenter igen.\n\nEn ekstra bitter kr\u00f8lle p\u00e5 det eventyr var, at Finn Juncker i Danmark forg\u00e6ves k\u00e6mpede med skattev\u00e6snet, der ikke ville anerkende hans rejse som forretning og udgifterne i den forbindelse som fradragsberettiget.\n\n- Jeg inds\u00e5, at det var slut. Min indsats og mine penge var tabt. De senegalesere, vi havde l\u00e6rt op som optikere her i Danmark, har aldrig f\u00e5et lov at praktisere i Senegal. Jeg m\u00e5 sige, at jeg har f\u00e5et et temmelig desillusioneret syn p\u00e5 ulandsst\u00f8tte. Pengene g\u00e5r i de forkerte lommer. Og vores projekt er desv\u00e6rre ikke enest\u00e5ende. Det er kendetegnende for en r\u00e6kke afrikanske lande, at nogle f\u00e5 magtfulde h\u00f8vdinge sidder p\u00e5 alt, og de er villige til at g\u00e5 langt for at f\u00e5 del i st\u00f8ttemidlerne. De bruger pengene til deres egen familie, til at sende deres b\u00f8rn p\u00e5 dyre skoler, til rejser og luksus. Det var situationen omkring brilleprojektet, og det var grunden til, at vi skulle betale s\u00e5 meget for mad og k\u00f8rsel. Tilbage st\u00e5r tusindvis af fattige og syge, som kunne have v\u00e6ret hjulpet ofte for et forholdsvis beskedent bel\u00f8b, siger Finn Juncker.\n\nHan har ikke fortrudt sin indsats i Afrika, men han er skuffet og \u00e6rgerlig. Sin trang til at g\u00f8re nytte og hj\u00e6lpe andre f\u00e5r han s\u00e5 udl\u00f8b for i Gr\u00f8nland.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "OpenWebText2"}}
{"text": "1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a motor drive apparatus which is, for example, used for driving an X-Y table of a monolithic wire bonder or a die bonder serving as one of IC manufacturing apparatus, and a method of controlling the same.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nThere is known a method of accurately stopping a motor at a target position, as disclosed in Unexamined Japanese Patent Application No. 55-77384/1980. In this prior art, after the motor passes through the target position, an error extreme point is obtained in order to determine a current value to be supplied to the motor to correct the error. Then, a rectangular current is supplied to the motor so as to eliminate the error and stop the motor at the target position.\nHereinafter, a background technology of the present invention will be explained. FIG. 10 is a block diagram showing one example of a motor drive apparatus controlling a typical three-phase synchronous motor. FIG. 11 is a detailed view showing a motor 1 of FIG. 10. FIG. 12 is a view showing inductive voltages of the motor 1 of FIG. 10. FIG. 13 is a view showing output signals from an encoder 2 shown in FIG. 10. FIG. 14 is a view showing an operation of a pulse converter 3 shown in FIG. 10. And, FIG. 15 is a detailed view showing a magnetic pole detector 4 of FIG. 10.\nIn FIG. 10, a reference numeral 1 represents a three-phase synchronous motor equipped with 9 slots and 6 poles. More specifically, as shown in FIG. 11, this three-phase synchronous motor comprises a stator 5 and a rotor 6. The stator 5 is associated with three coils of U-phase 7, V-phase 8, and W-phase 9 windings. This motor 1 has nine slots 10 disposed on an inside surface of the stator 5 which are spaced at intervals of 40 degrees. These nine slots 10 are wound by the coil windings in the order of U-phase, V-phase, and W-phase repetitively so as to form a star connection. On the other hand, the rotor 6 has six permanent magnet poles 11 disposed on the outer circumferential surface thereof.\nAn operational principle of the motor 1 will be explained below. The rotor 8 causes a magnetic field corresponding to its rotational position, which interacts with three, U-phase 7, V-phase 8, and W-phase 9, windings on the stator 5. Therefore, these three windings 7, 8, and 9 generate voltages due to Lorentz's force. Namely, three, U-phase 12, V-phase 13, and W-phase 14, inductive voltages of sine waveform are generated at intervals of 120 degrees as shown in FIG. 12 because a magnetic field to each winding is cyclically increased and decreased in response to spatial positioning of the permanent magnet 11 which cyclically approaches to and departs from each winding during one complete revolution of the rotor 6.\nIf sine-wave currents being in-phase with these inductive voltages of FIG. 12 are supplied to the U-phase 7, V-phase 8, and W-phase 9 windings, respectively, the rotor 6 generates a torque in a clockwise (abbreviated as CW) direction due to Fleming's left-hand rule. The magnitude of the torque generated is proportional to an amplitude of the current supplied. Moreover, if the above currents are further multiplied with -1 and delayed 180 degrees in phase before being supplied to respective windings, the rotor 6 generates a torque in a counterclockwise (abbreviated as CCW) direction.\nIn FIG. 10, a reference numeral 2 represents an optical encoder having three channels and installed on a rotor shaft of the motor 1. When the motor i rotates in the clockwise (CW) direction, the encoder 2 generates an A-phase signal 15 and a B-phase signal 18 having a mutual phase difference of 90 degrees therebetween as shown in FIG. 12, together with a Z-phase pulse signal 17 corresponding to one of zero-crossing 20 points of the U-phase inductive voltage 12. If the motor 1 rotates in the counterclockwise (CCW) direction, the phase relationship between the A-phase signal 15 and B-phase signal 16 are reversed. Therefore, the rotational direction of the motor 1 is easily judged by checking the phase relationship between the A-phase signal 15 and the B-phase signal 18.\nA reference numeral 3 represents a pulse converter connected to the encoder 2. This pulse converter 3 converts the A-phase and B-phase signals 15 and 18 into a CW pulse signal 18 as shown in FIG. 14 when the motor 1 rotates in the clockwise direction. On the contrary, this pulse converter 3 converts the A-phase and B-phase signals 15 and 16 into a CCW pulse signal 19 as shown in FIG. 14 when the motor 1 rotates in the counterclockwise direction. A reference numeral 4 represents a magnetic pole detector comprising a counter 20, a U-phase current phase command table 21, and a W-phase current phase command table 22. As shown in FIG. 15, the counter 20 receives the signals fed from the pulse converter 3 so as to effect its count-up and count-down operations in response to the CW pulse 18 and the CCW pulse 19, respectively. Furthermore, the counter 20 is connected to the encoder 2 so as to effect its clear operation in response to the Z-phase signal 17. The U-phase current phase command table 21 memorizes the phase of the U-phase inductive voltage 12 with respect to the Z-phase signal 17 of the encoder 2. The W-phase current phase command table 22 memorizes the phase of the W-phase inductive voltage 14 with respect to the Z-phase signal 17.\nAn operation of the magnetic pole detector 4 will be explained below. The counter 20 is cleared at the zero-cross point of the U-phase inductive voltage 12 in response to the Z-phase signal 17 fed from the encoder 2. When the motor 1 rotates, a rotational displacement or shift amount from the above zero-cross point of the U-phase inductive voltage 12 is counted by the counter 20. The counted value becomes a pointer 23 of the U-phase current phase command table 21 for outputting a phase value of the U-phase inductive voltage 12 corresponding to the present rotational position of the motor 1. In the same manner, the counted value of the counter 20 becomes a pointer 23 of the W-phase current phase command table 22 for outputting a phase value of the W-phase inductive voltage 14 corresponding to the present rotational position of the motor 1.\nThe magnetic pole detector 4 is connected to two multipliers 24U, 24W so that the phase values of the U-phase and W-phase inductive voltages 12 and 14 can be multiplied with an output of a speed control calculator 25. The speed control calculator 25 outputs a torque command value, i.e. a current amplitude command value. The multipliers 24U, 24W, therefore, multiply the current amplitude command value with the U-phase and W-phase current phase command values. The resultant two outputs from respective multipliers 24U, 24W are, then, fed to two D/A converters 28U, 28W so as to generate U-phase and W-phase current commands, respectively. These U-phase and W-phase current commands are, subsequently, fed to current amplifiers 27U, 27W in which drive currents to be supplied to the U-phase winding 7 and the W-phase winding 9 are generated in response to the U-phase and W-phase current commands, respectively.\nThe U-phase winding 7, the V-phase winding 8, and the W-phase winding 9 are connected with each other so as to constitute a star connection; therefore, the sum of currents flowing through these three-phase windings 7, 8, and 9 becomes 0. A current command for the V-phase winding 8 is, accordingly, identical with -(U-phase current command +W-phase current command). A subtracter 28 is therefore provided to obtain a V-phase current command equal to -(U-phase current command +W-phase current command). Thus obtained V-phase current command is, thereafter, fed to another current amplifier 27V in which a drive current to be supplied to the V-phase winding 8 is generated in response to the V-phase current command.\nA reference numeral 29 represents a speed detector connected to the pulse converter 3. This speed detector 29 detects the speed of the motor 1 by counting the number of pulses generated during a time measured by a timer 38 when the motor 1 rotates at a high speed and measuring an interval between successive pulses generated when the motor 1 rotates at a low speed. Reference numerals 31 and 32 represent a positive-direction position command pulse and a negative-direction position command pulse, respectively, fed from an external device. Reference numerals 33 and 34 represent subtracters.\nA reference numeral 35 represents a positional deviation reading sampler which is open-or-close controlled at predetermined intervals in response to an output signal from a timer 37. A reference numeral 38 represents a speed deviation reading sampler which is open-or-close controlled at predetermined intervals in response to an output signal from the timer 38. If these samplers 35 and 38 are closed, the speed control calculator 25, the magnetic pole detector 4, the multipliers 24U, 24W, and the D/A converters 28U, 28W are activated to renew the current commands to be supplied to the current amplifiers 27U, 27W.\nThe subtracter 34, constituted by an up-down counter, is counted up in response to the positive-direction position command pulse S1 and is counted down in response to the negative-direction position command pulse 32. The subtracter 34 is further counted down in response to the CW pulse 18 fed from the pulse converter S and is counted up in response to the CCW pulse 19. The subtracter 34 calculates a positional deviation through these count-up and count-down operations.\nA reference numeral 39 represents a position control calculator which amplifies the positional deviation obtained. The speed control calculator 25 amplifies a value supplied from the speed deviation reading sampler 38 to obtain a torque command, i.e. a current amplitude command.\nAn operation of the above-described motor drive apparatus will be explained below.\nFirst of all, the subtracter 34, constituted by an up-down counter, is counted up in response to the positive-direction position command pulse 31 and counted down in response to the negative-direction position command pulse 32, and is further counted down in response to the CW pulse 18 fed from the pulse converter 3 and counted up in response to the CCW pulse 19, in order to obtain the positional deviation. Furthermore, the position control calculator 39 inputs the positional deviation through the positional deviation reading sampler 35 being open-or-close controlled by the timer 37. The position control calculator 39 amplitudes this positional deviation and outputs a speed command so as to reduce the positional deviation.\nNext, the subtracter 33 subtracts this speed command by a feedback speed obtained from the speed detector 29 to generate a speed deviation. The speed control calculator 25 inputs the speed deviation through the speed deviation reading sampler 36 being-open-or-close controlled by the timer 38. The speed control calculator 25 amplitudes this speed deviation and generates a torque command, i.e. a current amplitude command.\nOn the other hand, when the motor 1 rotates in the clockwise (CW) direction, the encoder 2 generates the A-phase signal 15 and the B-phase signal 16 having a mutual phase difference of 90 degrees therebetween as shown in FIG. 12, together with the Z-phase pulse signal 17 corresponding to one of zero-crossing points of the U-phase inductive voltage 12. This A-phase signal 15 and B-phase signal 16 are, then, inputted into the pulse converter 3. These A-phase signal 15 and B-phase signal 16 are converted into the CW pulse 18 when the motor 1 rotates in the clockwise (CW) direction, and are converted into the CCW pulse 19 when the motor 1 rotates in the counterclockwise (CCW) direction.\nNext, the CW pulse signal 18 and the CCW pulse signal 19 outputted from the pulse converter 3, and the Z-phase signal 17 outputted from the encoder 2 are supplied to the magnetic pole detector 4. The counter 20 shown in FIG. 15 is counted up by the CW pulse signal 18 and counted down by the CCW pulse signal 19. Furthermore, the counter 20 is cleared by the Z-phase signal 17 fed from the encoder 2 to be 0. Namely, an arrival of the designated zero-cross point of the U-phase inductive voltage 12 is known by checking the Z-phase signal 17. And, a displacement or shift amount of the motor 1 from the designated zero-cross point of the U-phase inductive voltage 12 is known from the count value of the counter 20. The count value of the counter 20 becomes the pointer 23 of the U-phase current phase command table 21 for outputting the phase value of the U-phase inductive voltage 12 corresponding to the present rotational position of the motor 1. Moreover, the count value of the counter 20 becomes the pointer 23 of the W-phase current phase command table 22 for outputting the phase value of the W-phase inductive voltage 14 corresponding to the present rotational position of the motor 1.\nIn the multipliers 24U, 24W, the phase values of the U-phase and W-phase inductive voltages 12 and 14 are multiplied with the torque command outputted from the speed control calculator 25. Namely, the multipliers 24U, 24W multiply the current amplitude command value with the U-phase and W-phase current phase command values, respectively. The resultant two outputs from respective multipliers 24U, 24W are, then, fed to two D/A converters 26U, 26W so as to generate U-phase and W-phase current commands, respectively. These U-phase and W-phase current commands are, subsequently, fed to current amplifiers 27U, 27W in which the drive currents to be supplied to the U-phase winding 7 and the W-phase winding 9 are generated in response to the U-phase and W-phase current commands, respectively.\nOn the other hand, the subtracter 28 obtains the current command for the V-phase winding 8 by calculating the value identical with -(U-phase current command +W-phase current command). Thus obtained V-phase current command is, thereafter, fed to the current amplifier 27V in which the drive current to be supplied to the V-phase winding 8 is generated in response to the V-phase current command.\nIf the torque command is a positive value, the motor 1 generates a torque in the clockwise (CW) direction. On the contrary, if the torque command is a negative value, the motor 1 generates a torque in the counterclockwise (CCW) direction because the multipliers 24U and 24W generate U-phase and W-phase current commands having 180-degree phase difference with respect to respective U-phase and W-phase current phase commands. Thus, the speed deviation is decreased. In accordance with the reduction of the speed deviation, the positional deviation becomes small.\nFIG. 9(A) shows a sampling interval of the speed deviation reading sampler 36 applied to both moving and stationary conditions of the motor 1. FIG. 9(B) shows a sampling interval of the positional deviation reading sampler 35 applied to both moving and stationary conditions of the motor 1.\nWhen the motor 1 is in a moving condition, in order to stabilize the motor drive operation by the above-described motor drive apparatus, the speed control must be performed by using three times or more sampling with respect to the calculated speed command as shown in FIG. 9. The reason why three times or more sampling are required when the motor 1 is in a moving condition is as follows.\nIf the speed command sampling interval is identical with the control sampling interval in the speed control operation, the motor 1 will not be able to sufficiently follow up the speed command because, even if the speed of the motor 1 is controlled to coincide with the speed command value, the speed command value itself may vary at the next coming control sampling timing. Thus, the speed of the motor 1 cannot be stabilized. Especially, as the positional command varies widely when the motor 1 is in a moving condition, the speed command will correspondingly cause wide variation. Hence, three times or more sampling are required for allowing the motor 1 to follow up the speed command. For this reason, the speed of the timer 37 is set 1/3 or less compared with that of the timer 38.\nIn accordance with the above motor drive apparatus, the sampling interval of the positional deviation reading sampler 35 will be sufficiently extended or elongated so as to stabilize the motor speed control during the moving condition of the motor. However, when the motor 1 is in a stationary condition, the sampling interval of the positional deviation reading sampler 35 will be too long to accurately detect a small positional deviation if this small positional deviation varies at a period smaller than that of the positional deviation reading sampler 35. Consequently, there is a problem that the positioning control cannot be accurately and responsively performed when the motor is in a stationary condition.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "USPTO Backgrounds"}}

{"text": "When Rudy Gay left the game with a left knee injury late in the first quarter, memories of the Sacramento Kings\u2019 (16-22) recent poor play minus a star resurfaced. The thought came to fruition as DeMarcus Cousins joined him on the sidelines in the waning seconds of regulation, and the short-handed Kings fell to the visiting Dallas Mavericks (27-12), 108-104.\n\nThe Kings are currently 2-2 on their six-game home stand and return to action on Friday in a contest against the Miami Heat. Join Cowbell Kingdom\u2019sJames Ham as he recaps the action from the floor of Sleep Train Arena.\n\nGolden State Warriors Projected Starters (31-22)\n\nWhat to watch\n\n1. Can the Kings win without DeMarcus Cousins?\n\nThe Kings are 0-7 without their starting center and it looks like Cousins will miss another game on Wednesday with a strained left hip flexor. Andrew Bogut is questionable for the Warrior with left shoulder inflammation, as is reserve Jermaine O\u2019Neal (sore back). This game might turn into a track meet, which doesn\u2019t bode well for Sacramento.\n\n2. Can the Kings defend the 3-point line?\n\nSacramento ranks 28th in the league against the long ball. The Warriors starting backcourt of Curry and Thompson have already shot close to 800 3-pointers on the season. If the Kings don\u2019t stay with Golden State\u2019s shooters, they have very little chance of pulling off the upset.\n\n3. How do the Kings players handle the trade rumors?\n\nThe trade deadline is 12pm PST on Thursday and the rumors are swirling. Do the Kings players crumble under the pressure or do they come out swinging in what might be their last game in Sacramento?\n\nAccording to an NBA source, Sacramento Kings point guard Isaiah Thomas underwent an MRI earlier Tuesday on his left wrist. Counter to other media reports, the results of the tests were negative and Thomas is not expected to miss any time with the injury.\n\nSince taking over the starting position 35 games ago, Thomas is averaging 21.5 points, 6.9 assists and 1.3 steals per game in 37.5 minutes. But rumors that he was having some discomfort in his wrist began a few weeks back.\n\nRecently, his shooting numbers have taken a dramatic dip, beginning in January when he shot just 41.2 percent from the field and 32.7 percent from long range. Thomas\u2019s overall field goal percentage has bounced back in the month of February, but his 3-point percentage for the seven games this month is 24.1 percent.\n\nThomas and rookie guard Ben McLemore were the subject of a trade rumor on Monday, but coach Michael Malone and general manager Pete D\u2019Alessandro refuted the reports following practice on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThe report that was, I think on Yahoo!, about our offer to Boston was so erroneous and I don\u2019t know where it came from,\u201d Malone told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe dispel the rumors that are out there that we know are not true, but at the same time, this is a business and you have no idea what can happen up until trade deadline. I think all of our players realize that.\u201d\n\nWith injuries and possible trade rumors swirling, it should be a wild couple of days in Sacramento.\n\nDeMarcus Cousins Injury Update\n\nThomas wasn\u2019t the only Kings player to undergo an MRI today. For the second straight day, center DeMarcus Cousins made a trip to the doctors office for testing. Results of the first MRI were inconclusive, but a second test confirmed the Kings medical staff\u2019s earlier diagnosis of a strained left hip flexor.\n\nCousins has been unable to participate in practice since returning from the All-Star break. He is listed as day-to-day, but considered doubtful for Wednesday\u2019s match-up against the Golden State Warriors.\n\nHamady Ndiaye out of Rutgers and DeQuan Jones out of Florida are the only late additions. Ndiaye was in camp last season with Sacramento and left a solid impression. After being waived by the Kings, the 26-year old center spent last season playing for Tianjin Ronggang Golden Lions of the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nJones played in 63 games last season with the Orlando Magic, including 17 starts. He averaged 3.7 points per game in a little under 13 minutes a game.\n\nLast season it was high ropes courses in Colorado Springs, Co. This year, the Sacramento Kings open training camp away from home again, but instead of the Team USA practice facility in Colorado, it will be on the sandy beaches of Santa Barbara, CA. Camp will run from Oct. 1-6 at the Pavilion Gym on the University of California, Santa Barbara campus.\n\nThe team will head back to Northern California for their pre-season opener on the road against the Golden State Warriors on October 7, before heading to Las Vegas to take on the Lakers on Oct. 10.\n\nAfter the initial week away, the Kings will continue camp in Sacramento at the team\u2019s practice facility in Natomas.\n\nCowbell Kingdom has grown exponentially since its founding in 2009 and we want to make sure we know our audience. The information you provide in this brief survey will be used to help us better serve you. For your participation, you will be automatically entered into a contest to win a copy of the 2013-14 Sacramento Kings Dancers calendar and a \u201cBlackout\u201d t-shirt commemorating last season\u2019s first home game.\n\nBut there\u2019s probably no other player more overlooked and underrated on this season\u2019s roster than the fourth-year guard. Just look no further than ESPN.com\u2019s annual NBA Rank, which appraises the value of the league\u2019s top 500 players. The 25-year-old guard moved up just five spots (no. 136 in 2011 to no. 131 in 2012) in this year\u2019s rankings. These were the five players ranked just ahead of Thornton in the 2012 forecast:\n\nSuch is life on a bad team with little to no national exposure. However, those who follow the Kings closely know just how valuable Thornton is, especially his competition.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s become an outstanding scorer in this league,\u201d said Dallas Mavericks guard Darren Collisonback in January of his former New Orleans Hornets teammate. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely made a niche in this league as far as (being) a big time scorer.\n\n\u201cHe can shoot the ball extremely well and he can do a lot of different things off the pick and roll,\u201d added Collison. \u201cAnd he\u2019s exceptionally quick too.\u201d\n\nIn their rookie year, Collison and Thornton formed an explosive and exciting young backcourt for the Hornets. Though they\u2019ve since gone their separate ways, the two remain close. Thornton worked out last offseason with Collison in Los Angeles during the lockout.\n\nThe fourth-year guard out of UCLA thinks Sacramento is a good fit for his old teammate. He believes Thornton will only continue to improve with the Kings\u2019 green nucleus.\n\n\u201cThis is a young team that\u2019s going to be good in the near future,\u201d Collison said. \u201cHe has a starting role here, so anytime you have a starting role, it\u2019s always a good fit. And he\u2019s one of their best scorers, too.\u201d\n\nAveraging 18.7 points per game, Thornton led the Kings in scoring last season and usually found himself as their go-to-guy in clutch situations. The next step for Thornton, according to another former teammate, is becoming an accomplished defender.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always been a capable scorer,\u201d said Indiana Pacers big man David West. \u201cKey for him has always been for him to play as hard defensively as he does offensively.\u201d\n\nAs explosive as he is with the ball, Thornton could stand to see some improvement on the defensive end. The Louisiana native finished in the bottom three among his 15 teammates in defensive rating.\n\n\u201cWe would challenge him to do the same thing on the defensive end,\u201d said West of his days with Thornton in New Orleans. \u201cMake him more of a complete ball player.\u201d\n\nHowever like Collison, West thinks Thornton will continue to find success in the league.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a strong-minded, tough-minded kid,\u201d West said. \u201cI knew that once he got an opportunity to just get in a system that worked for him and bring out his best skills, he\u2019d do well.\u201d\n\nThe Kings may not belong to Marcus Thornton. But his importance to their success isn\u2019t an understatement.\n\nTwenty-five years ago today, Sacramento Kings Head Coach Keith Smart hit a shot that changed his life forever.\n\nNo matter where I go, people talk about it. Once they recognize me or see a nametag on my bag or something like that, they start talking about \u201cThe Shot\u201d. So it\u2019s a great moment and I\u2019m glad it went in, but wasn\u2019t just something for me.\n\nWe just had our 25 year championship reunion. And we all got together and it wasn\u2019t so much what we all did in the tournament and our careers. It was a friendship and a relationship that we have now that that moment brings us all together.\n\nDiehard Sacramento Kings fan Kevin Fippin wanted to propose to his long-time girlfriend Lydia Nicolaisen.

{"text": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monoallelic disorder associated with progressive cyst development and resulting in end stage renal failure (ESRD) in 50% of patients by 60y. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability, extending from in utero onset to patients with adequate renal function into old age. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), as traditionally defined, results in PLD with minimal renal cysts. Classically there have been considered two ADPKD genes, PKD1 and PKD2, encoding PC1 and PC2, and two ADPLD genes, PRKCSH and SEC63, but in the past few years greater genetic heterogeneity has been described, with nine genes now implicated overall. Recent data also indicates an overlap in etiology and pathogenesis associated with ADPKD and ADPLD, with the efficient biogenesis and localization of the PC-complex central to both disorders. During the last funding period we identified a novel gene, GANAB, which is associated with both disorders, where the encoded protein, GII?? is involved in the maturation and trafficking of PC1. In this proposal we will take advantage of advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) methodologies, and large populations of ADPKD and ADPLD patients that have been assembled and screened for the classic genes, to hunt for novel genes for these disorders (Aim 1). The phenotype associated with these genes will be characterized (Aim 3) along with their mechanism of action (Aim 2). NGS methods will be perfected to screen the segmentally duplicated locus, PKD1, and to identify missed mutations at the known loci, including those present in just some cells due to mosaicism (Aim 1). The significance of many PKD1 nontruncating variants has been difficult to evaluate (classed as variants of unknown significance; VUS), but recently evidence that some are incompletely penetrant alleles partially explains phenotypic variability in PKD1 populations. In Aim 2 improved in silico predictions, in combination with machine learning, will improve the understanding of the pathogenicity and penetrance of VUS. A cellular assay of the biogenesis and trafficking of this PC-complex will also be employed to quantify the penetrance of VUS. The mechanism of pathogenesis will be explored in animal models with ultralow penetrant (ULP) Pkd1 or Pkd2 alleles. Employing the large clinically, imaging, and genetically well-defined populations phenotypic groupings of patients will be defined that will then be compared to the genic and PKD1 allelic groups (Aim 3). This iterative process will allow the Variant Score (VS) associated with each PKD1 VUS to be refined. In a separate population the revised VS, alone and in combination with clinical, functional, and imaging data, will be employed to generate a comprehensive, predictive algorithm for ADPKD (Aim 3). Disease modifiers to severe disease, via biallelic ADPKD, and due to alleles at other loci will also be identified and characterized in the cellular assay and in vivo in combination with the Pkd1 hypomorphic, RC model. The final aim will exploit the newly identified information that some PKD1 and PKD2 VUS are rescuable, folding mutations that in a maturation-fostering environment can traffic and function appropriately. A screening scheme based on the level of cell surface PC1 will be improved and new chaperone drugs specific for the PC complex will be sought in collaboration with Sanford Burnham Prebys. A second mutation group that will be explored therapeutically are nonsense mutations. A cellular assay for readthrough efficiency is being developed and will be used for screening. Identified chaperone or readthrough drugs will be tested in available mouse models. Overall this proposal will better explain the etiology and the genetic causes of phenotypic variability in ADPKD/ADPLD, develop better prognostic tools for individual selection of patients for treatment that are now becoming available, and explore allele based treatments for ADPKD.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "NIH ExPorter"}}

But how to do it for relations?\n\nI cannot set the value to the id of the related record, as Doctrine2 will complain.\nIt's fine if the configured default is a \"Reference\" to the status entity. The available status' are fixed and won't change (often).\n\nHow do I configure the entity to have a proper default relation configured.\nPreferably not in a listener when persisting, as the status may be requested before that.\n\nA:\n\nThere are several approaches but I would suggest using the OrderRepository as a factory for creating new orders.\nclass OrderRepository\n{\n    public function create()\n    {\n        $order = new Order();\n        $status = $this->_em->find('Status','default'); // or getReference\n        $order->setStatus($status);\n        return $order;\n    }\n}\n\n// In a controller\n$orderRepository = $this->container->get('order_repository');\n$order = $orderRepository->create();\n\nBy going with a repository you can initialize complex entity graphs that will be ready for persisting.\n==========================================================================\nPlan B would be to do this sort of thing within the order object and then use listeners to \"fix things up\" before persisting or updating.\nclass Order\n{\n    public function __construct()\n    {\n        $this->status = new Status('Default');\n    }\n}\n\nThe problem of course is that a default status object already exists in the database so when you flush you will get a error.  So you need to hang an onFlush(http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/events.html#onflush) listener on the entity manager, check to see if the status object is being managed by the entity manager and, if not, replace it with a managed object fetched via the entity manager.\nThis approach lets you deal with more \"pure\" domain models without worrying as much about the persistence layer.  On the other hand, dealing with the flush can be tricky.  On the gripping hand, once you get it working then it does open up some major possibilities.\n========================================================\nThere is also the question of what exactly the status entity does.  If all it contains is some sort of status state ('entered',processed') etc.  Then you might consider just having it be a string.  Sort of like the ROLE_USER objects.\n\n", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "StackExchange"}}

{"text": "From the mid-1960's until the close of that decade, automobiles became lighter, more compact, and more powerful. Auto manufacturers continued to compete against one another for drag-strip supremacy. As government regulations and safety concerns increased, the muscle car era began to decline rapidly.\n\nMany of these ultimate high-performance muscle cars were built to satisfy homologation requirements. Others were built just to have the fastest machine on the road. The Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda is an example of one of the fiercest and most powerful vehicle ever constructed for the roadway. It was derived from the lesser Barracuda's which began in the mid-1960's. It was built atop the 'E' body platform and was restyled in 1970 by John Herlitz, making it longer, wider, and lower. The 426 cubic-inch Hemi V8 was capable of producing an astonishing 425 horsepower. Matted to a four-speed manual 833 transmission, this was the ultimate muscle car of its day.\n\nThis 1971 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda Convertible with black paint and orange billboards was offered for sale at the 2006 RM Auction in Monterey, CA where it was expected to sell between $180,000-$220,000. It came equipped from the factory with power windows, power brakes, power steering, Rally instrument cluster, rim blow steering wheel, bucket seats, AM/FM cassette radio, and driving lights. It has a Dana '60' rear end and the 426 cu in engine. It is one of just 374 'Cda Convertibles built in 1971. On auction day bidding reached $165,000 which was not high enough to satisfy reserve. The vehicle was left unsold.By Daniel Vaughan | Dec 2006\n\nThis 'Cuda Convertible was given a show-quality restoration to original specifications and is one of just 374 examples originally produced for the 1971 model year. It is believed to be one of just 87 383-powered convertibles produced for the last year of 'Cuda convertible production in 1971. The 383 cubic-inch V8 has four-barrel carburetors and is capable of producing 300 horsepower. There is a TorqueFlite three-speed automatic gearbox and four-wheel hydraulic brakes.\n\nThe car is finished in Tawny Gold, with a white interior and a white power-operated convertible top. Features include dual chrome-tipped exhaust outlets, floor console, hood pins, power brakes, power steering, Rallye wheels, a 'Slap Stik' shifter and a 'Tuff' steering wheel.\n\nIn 2010, this 'Cuda Convertible was offered for sale at the Vintage Motor Cars of Meadow Brook presented by RM Auctions. The car was estimated to sell for $60,000 - $70,000. As bidding came to a close, the car had been sold for the sum of $44,000 including buyer's premium.By Daniel Vaughan | Aug 2010\n\nV8 Cuda Convertible\n\nThe 3rd generation Barracuda ran from 1970 through 1974; the previous generations were A-body Valiant based which began in 1964. Designed by John E. Herlitz on the 108-inch wheelbase, unibody, E-platform, a shorter and wider version of the existing B-body. This example has the non-Hemi 340 cubic-inch V8 with automatic and it is a stock example. 1971 was the only year for four headlamps. Somehow, this model series didn't sell to expectation and production slowed over the years, making the cars quite rare today. An unaltered car is even more rare.\n\nV8 Cuda Hard Top Coupe\n\nThe writing was on the wall by 1971 for the muscle car enthusiast. With rising gas prices and skyrocketing insurance rates, the days of the overpowered and often low priced performance automobile were numbered. For the big three, it seems that the decision was made to go out with a bang, and some of the rarest and most desirable muscle cars ever to come out of the Motor City were produced.\n\nAmong the hottest is the Hemi 'Cuda, produced for a mere two model years. In 1970, it is believed that Plymouth produced just 696 Hemi 'Cuda hardtops and for 1971, a mere 118 would leave the line.\n\nWild colors would survive for the 1971 model year and Chrysler would lead the pack with their Hi-Impact color palate. Several eye popping colors were offered, including Sassy Grass Green as seen on this example, which is one of the rarest offerings.\n\nWhen it comes to American Muscle, the Plymouth hemi 'Cuda is always at the top of the list. And when it comes to rarity and desirability, nothing compares to a 1971 Hemi ' Cuda.\n\nNo matter what make or model you may prefer, there is no disputing the visual impact of the 426 Street Hemi engine. With the massive valve covers and the huge dual quad carbs, it certainly takes top honors when it comes to intimidation. To add the outrageous FC7 in Violet, (aka Plum Crazy) paint to the mix is to take things a step beyond.\n\nThis 1971 Hemi 'Cuda exemplifies what Mopar Performance was all about in the final years of the original Muscle Car era. With a mere 107 leaving the Hamtramck, Michigan assembly plant with the Hemi engine under the shaker hood, these cars were rare even when new. This car is one of just 48 equipped with the Torqueflite automatic transmission and it also features the rare leather interior, elastomeric color keyed bumpers, power steering and power front disc brakes, a center console, the AM radio with the Dictaphone cassette recorder, tinted glass, dual color keyed mirrors and more, making it one of the highest option 1971 Hemi 'Cuda's in existence.\n\nOf course, when new these cars were flogged not only on the street, but at the tracks throughout the country, making this example among the most sought after and valuable American muscle cars ever built.\n\nThe first series of the Barracuda was produced from 1964 through 1969, distinguished by its A-body construction. From 1970 through 1974 the second series was produced using an E-body construction.\n\nIn 1964, Plymouth offered the Barracuda as an option of the Valiant model line, meaning it wore both the Valiant and Barracuda emblems. The base offering was a 225 cubic-inch six-cylinder engine that produced with 180 horsepower. An optional Commando 273 cubic-inch eight-cylinder engine was available with a four-barrel carburetor, high-compression heads and revised cams. The vehicle was outfitted with a live rear axle and semi-elliptic springs. Unfortunately, the Barracuda was introduced at the same time, separated by only two weeks, as the Ford Mustang. The Mustang proved to be the more popular car outselling the Valiant Barracuda by a ratio of 8 to 1.\n\nThe interior was given a floor-shifter, vinyl semi-bucket seats, and rear seating. The rear seats folded down allowing ample space for cargo.\n\nBy 1967, Plymouth redesigned the Barracuda and added a coupe and convertible to the model line-up. To accommodate larger engines, the engine bay was enlarged. There were multiple engine offerings that ranged in configuration and horsepower ratings. The 225 cubic-inch six-cylinder was the base engine while the 383 cubic-inch 8-cylinder was the top-of-the-line producing 280 horsepower. That was impressive, especially considering the horsepower to weight ratio. Many chose the 340 cubic-inch eight-cylinder because the 383 and Hemi were reported to make the Barracuda nose-heavy while the 340 offered optimal handling.\n\nIn 1968 Plymouth offered a Super Stock 426 Hemi package. The lightweight body and race-tuned Hemi were perfect for the drag racing circuit. Glass was replaced with lexan, non-essential items were removed, and lightweight seats with aluminum brackets replaced the factory bench, and were given a sticker that indicated the car was not to be driven on public highways but for supervised acceleration trials. The result was a car that could run the quarter mile in the ten-second range.\n\nFor 1969 a limited number of 440 Barracudas were produced, giving the vehicle a zero-to-sixty time of around 5.6 seconds.\n\nIn 1970 the Barracuda were restyled but shared similarities to the 1967 through 1969 models. The Barracuda was available in convertible and hardtop configuration; the fastback was no longer offered. Sales were strong in 1970 but declined in the years that followed. The muscle car era was coming to a close due to the rising government safety and emission regulations and insurance premiums. Manufacturers were forced to detune their engines. The market segment was slowly shifting from muscle-cars to luxury automobiles. 1974 was the final year Plymouth offered the Barracuda.By Daniel Vaughan | Aug 2010\n\n\u25feDodge Charger and Durango 'most loved' in their respective segments for second consecutive year\n\u25feJeep\u00ae Renegade leads Entry SUV segment in 2015 Most Loved Vehicles in America survey by Strategic Vision\n\u25feFIAT captures most segment wins among small cars with 500 and 500e\n\u25feFCA US ranked highest overall in Strategic Vision's 20th annual Total Quality Index\u2122 this past July\nNovember 24, 2015 , Auburn Hills, Mich. - Strategic Vision has named five FCA US LLC vehicles to its 'Most Loved Ve...[Read more...]\n\nScottsdale, Arizona (July 18th, 2015) \u2013 Thomas Scott is an accountant and entrepreneur from Athens, Georgia who has had a love for all things automotive for as long as he can remember.

{"text": "INTRODUCTION {#s1}\n============\n\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) is still a major global health problem, with an estimated 257 million people worldwide that are chronically infected with HBV ([@B1]). HBV, together with duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and several other related animal viruses, belongs to the *Hepadnaviridae* family ([@B2]). The HBV virion is comprised of an outer envelope and an inner icosahedral nucleocapsid (NC) assembled by 240 copies of core protein (HBc) and packaged with a 3.2-kb partially double-stranded circular DNA genome ([@B3][@B4][@B8]). In addition to DNA-containing virions, a large amount of incomplete viral particles, such as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) particles, empty virions, and naked capsids, can also be released from cells in the process of virus replication ([@B9]). Subviral HBsAg particles are spherical or rodlike and are present in vast excess over virions in sera of CHB patients ([@B2]). Empty virions share the same structure as DNA-containing virions but are devoid of nucleic acids ([@B10][@B11][@B14]). Naked capsids, which exit cells via a route different from that of virions ([@B15][@B16][@B17]), have the same structure as NCs but are either empty or filled with viral RNA and immature viral DNA ([@B7], [@B11], [@B18][@B19][@B20]).\n\nIn NC, pgRNA undergoes reverse transcription into minus-strand DNA, followed by plus-strand DNA synthesis ([@B2], [@B21][@B22][@B24]). Intracellular NCs can be packaged with viral nucleic acids at all levels of maturation, including pgRNA, nascent minus-strand DNA, minus-strand DNA-RNA hybrids, and relaxed circular DNA (RC DNA) or double-stranded linear DNA (DSL DNA) ([@B5], [@B7]). Only the NCs with relatively mature viral DNA (RC or DSL DNA) are enveloped and secreted as virions. HBV replicating cells can release empty core particles assembled from HBc proteins and NCs that contain various species of replicative intermediate nucleic acids into the culture supernatant. However, while free naked capsids could be readily detected *in vitro* ([@B7], [@B11], [@B18][@B19][@B20]), they are hardly found in the blood of HBV-infected patients ([@B17], [@B25], [@B26]).\n\nAlthough extracellular HBV RNA was detected in both *in vitro* cell culture systems and in clinical serum samples, its origin and composition remain controversial. It was proposed that extracellular HBV RNA represents pgRNA localized in virions ([@B27]). However, HBV spliced RNA and HBx RNA were also detected in culture supernatant of HBV stably replicating cells as well as in sera of CHB patients ([@B28], [@B29]). In addition, extracellular HBV RNA was also suggested to originate from damaged liver cells ([@B30]), naked capsids, or exosomes ([@B11], [@B29]). Hence, these extracellular RNA molecules have never been conclusively characterized. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular HBV RNAs are heterogeneous in length, ranging from full-length pgRNA (3.5 kilonucleotides \\[knt\\]) to RNA fragments with merely several hundred nucleotides. These RNA molecules represent 3\u2032 receding pgRNA fragments that have not been completely reverse transcribed to DNA and pgRNA fragments hydrolyzed by the RNase H domain of polymerase in the process of viral replication. More importantly, extracellular HBV RNAs are localized in naked capsids and in virions in culture supernatants of HBV replicating cells and also circulate as CACs and virions in blood of hepatitis B patients.\n\nRESULTS {#s2}\n=======\n\nExtracellular HBV RNAs are heterogeneous in length and predominantly integral to naked capsids instead of virions in HepAD38 cell culture supernatant. {#s2.1}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo ascertain the origin of extracellular HBV RNA, we first examined viral particles prepared from culture medium of an *in vitro* HBV stably transduced cell line. A human hepatoma HepAD38 cell line was used in this study, as it sustains vigorous HBV replication under the control of a tetracycline-repressible cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter ([@B31]). Total viral particles were concentrated and centrifuged over a 10% to 60% (wt/wt) sucrose gradient. Most of the subviral HBsAg particles, virions, and empty virions were detected between fractions 9 to 14 ([Fig. 1A](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, upper and middle). Naked capsids, detected only by anti-HBcAg and not by anti-HBsAg antibodies, settled in fractions 5 to 8 ([Fig. 1A](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, middle and lower). The majority of viral nucleic acids were detected in fractions between 4 and 11 ([Fig. 1B](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, upper), which coincided with the fractions containing virions (fractions 9 to 11), naked capsids (fractions 4 to 7), and the mixture of these particles (fraction 8). Consistent with previous observations, HBV virions are packed with mature viral DNA (RC or DSL DNA), while naked capsids contain both immature single-stranded DNA (SS DNA) and mature viral DNA ([Fig. 1B](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, upper). Moreover, Northern blot results showed that most of the HBV RNA was detected in the naked capsids ([Fig. 1B](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lower, fractions 4 to 7), whereas only a very small amount was associated with virions ([Fig. 1B](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lower, fractions 9 to 11). HBV RNA detected in naked capsids ranged from the full length of pgRNA down to a few hundred nucleotides (shorter than the HBx mRNA \\[0.7 knt\\]). Moreover, RNA molecules within virions were much shorter than those within naked capsids. We excluded the possibility of artifacts generated by the SDS-proteinase K extraction method, as a similar RNA blot pattern was obtained using a TRIzol reagent to extract both intracellular nucleocapsid-associated and extracellular HBV RNA (not shown). Furthermore, quantification of viral RNA extracted by either the SDS-proteinase K method or TRIzol reagent produced a very similar copy number, except that the TRIzol reagent is known to preferentially extract RNA rather than DNA (not shown). Moreover, the RNA signal detected by Northern blotting could not be attributed to DNA fragments generated by DNase I treatment, which would reduce DNA to below the detection limit of the hybridization method (not shown). Furthermore, the RNA signal could be completely removed by an additional RNase A treatment (not shown).\n\n![Sucrose gradient separation and analysis of viral particles from HepAD38 cell culture supernatant. (A) Distribution of hepatitis B viral particle-associated antigens and DNA/RNA in sucrose gradient. Viral particles prepared from HepAD38 cell culture supernatant (via PEG 8000 precipitation) were layered over a 10% to 60% (wt/wt) sucrose gradient for ultracentrifugation separation. Fractions were collected from top to bottom, and HBsAg level was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). HBsAg and viral DNA and RNA (quantified from gray density of bands in panel B) signals and sucrose density were plotted together. Viral particles were first resolved by native agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting (IB) of HBV envelope and core proteins with anti-HBsAg and anti-HBcAg antibodies. (B) Detection of viral DNA/RNA by Southern or Northern blotting. Total viral nucleic acids were extracted by the SDS-proteinase K method, and viral DNA (extracted from one-tenth of the samples used for Northern blotting) and RNA (treated with DNase I) were detected by Southern and Northern blot analyses with minus- or plus-strand-specific riboprobes, respectively. Symbols of HBsAg particles, empty virions (without nucleic acid), virions (with RC DNA), and naked capsids (empty or with nucleic acids) are depicted on the lower right side of panel A. Blank, no nucleic acids; two centered and gapped circles, RC DNA; straight line, SS DNA; wavy lines, pgRNA; M, markers (50\u2009pg of 1-kb, 2-kb, and 3.2-kb DNA fragments released from plasmids as the DNA ladder or total RNA extracted from HepAD38 cells as the RNA ladder).](zjv0241840640001){#F1}\n\nTo confirm the above-described results and to better separate naked capsids from HBV virions, isopycnic CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation was employed. Naked capsids were observed mainly in fractions 5 to 7, with densities ranging from 1.33 to 1.34\u2009g/cm^3^ ([Fig. 2A](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The smearing bands of naked capsids were likely caused by high concentrations of CsCl salt, as fractionation of naked capsids in a 1.18-g/cm^3^ CsCl solution produced single bands. Virions, detected by both anti-HBcAg and anti-HBsAg antibodies ([Fig. 2A](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}, upper and middle), were packaged with viral DNA ([Fig. 2A](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lower) and settled in fractions 13 to 15, with densities ranging from 1.23 to 1.25\u2009g/cm^3^. In agreement with the results shown in [Fig. 1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, HBV virions contained only the mature viral DNA (RC or DSL DNA), while naked capsids contained viral DNA replicative intermediates that ranged from the nascent minus-strand DNA to mature viral DNA ([Fig. 2B](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [C](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The lengths of viral minus- and plus-strand DNA in naked capsids and virions were determined by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis analysis, a condition where denatured single-stranded DNA molecules migrate according to their lengths. In contrast to the complete minus- and mostly complete plus-strand DNA (closed to 3.2 knt) in virions, in naked capsids the minus-strand DNA and the plus-strand DNA can be both complete and incomplete (shorter than 3.2 knt) ([Fig. 2D](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [E](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Moreover, the length of HBV RNAs within naked capsids still ranged from 3.5 knt of pgRNA to shorter than the 0.7 knt of HBx mRNA. Full-length pgRNA accounted for only 10% of total RNA signal detected by Northern blotting (quantified from gray density of bands shown in [Fig. 2F](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). In contrast, HBV RNA species in virions are relatively shorter and barely detectable. In addition, we also determined viral DNA and RNA copy numbers in pooled naked capsids (fractions 3 to 7) and virions (fractions 10 to 21) by quantitative PCR. Quantification results showed that viral DNA in naked capsids and in virions accounted for about 60% and 40%, respectively, of total viral DNA signal in the HepAD38 cell culture supernatant ([Fig. 2G](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). More importantly, 84% of the HBV RNA was associated with naked capsids, while merely 16% was detected within virions ([Fig. 2G](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Additionally, the DNA/RNA ratio was 11 in virions and 3 in naked capsids ([Fig. 2H](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}), suggesting that more HBV RNA is present in naked capsids.\n\n![CsCl density gradient separation and analysis of viral particles from HepAD38 cell culture supernatant. (A) Native agarose gel analysis of viral particles. Culture supernatant of HepAD38 cells was concentrated (via ultrafiltration) and fractionated by CsCl density gradient centrifugation (3\u2009ml of 1.18 g/cm^3^ CsCl solution in the upper layer and 1.9\u2009ml of 1.33 g/cm^3^ CsCl solution in the lower layer). Viral particles in each fraction were resolved by native agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by detection of viral antigens with anti-HBsAg and anti-HBcAg antibodies and viral DNA by hybridization with minus-strand-specific riboprobe. (B to F) Southern and Northern blot detection of viral nucleic acids. Viral DNAs were separated by electrophoresis through Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) or alkaline (ALK) agarose gel for Southern blotting with minus- or plus-strand-specific riboprobes. Viral RNA was obtained by treatment with total nucleic acids with DNase I and separated by formaldehyde-MOPS agarose gel, followed by Northern blotting. (G) Quantification of viral DNA and RNA in naked capsids or virions. Fractions containing naked capsids (fractions 3 to 7) or virions (fractions 10 to 21) were pooled, and viral DNA and RNA were quantified by PCR. (H) DNA and RNA ratios in naked capsids and virions calculated based on quantitative results. Asterisks indicate unknown high-density viral particles detected by anti-HBcAg or anti-HBsAg antibodies but devoid of any HBV-specific nucleic acids. M, markers (E. coli-derived HBV capsids or DNA and RNA ladders as described in the legend to [Fig. 1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}).](zjv0241840640002){#F2}\n\nExtracellular HBV RNAs and immature viral DNA are detected in sera from CHB patients. {#s2.2}\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEmploying the HepAD38 cell culture system, we demonstrated the presence of extracellular HBV RNAs and immature and mature viral DNA packaged in both the naked capsids and virions. Interestingly, Southern blot analyses showed that SS DNA could also be observed in serum samples from some CHB patients. We speculated that SS DNA in circulation would be carried by capsid particles that were released by HBV-infected hepatocytes into patients' bloodstreams. However, we reasoned that due to strong immunogenicity of naked capsids ([@B32], [@B33]), it would be difficult to detect them as free particles; rather, they would form complexes with specific anti-HBcAg antibodies and therefore circulate as antigen-antibody complexes ([@B25], [@B32][@B33][@B34]). To entertain this possibility, we then used protein A/G agarose beads to pull down the immune complexes. Forty-five serum samples obtained from CHB patients, with HBV DNA titers higher than 10^7^\u2009IU per ml, were examined for the presence of particles containing SS DNA by a combination of protein A/G agarose bead pulldown assay and Southern blot analysis ([Fig. 3A](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [B](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). SS DNA was detected, albeit to a different extent, in 34 serum samples ([Fig. 3A](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [B](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}, upper). The particles containing SS DNA were pulled down by protein A/G agarose beads from 11 out of the 34 samples ([Fig. 3A](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [B](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lower). Patient sera negative for SS DNA (patients 37, 38, 14, and 35) or positive for SS DNA (patients 17, 21, 42, and 44), as determined by the protein A/G agarose bead pulldown experiments, were selected for further studies ([Fig. 3C](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n![Characterization of HBV DNA and RNA in sera of CHB patients. (A and B) Analyses of serum viral DNA from CHB patients by Southern blotting. Viral DNA was extracted from serum samples obtained from forty-five chronic hepatitis B patients (20% of input sample used for protein A/G agarose beads pulldown) and subjected to Southern blot analysis. Alternatively, these samples were first incubated with protein A/G agarose beads, and then viral DNA in the pulldown mixtures was analyzed by Southern blotting. Serum samples selected for further examining are marked with arrows, and samples with SS DNA detection are labeled with asterisks. (C) Protein A/G agarose bead pulldown of viral particles. Sera (25\u2009\u03bcl each) from CHB patients 37, 38, 14, and 35 (M1, mixture one) or from patients 17, 21, 42, and 44 (M2, mixture two) were pooled and incubated with protein A/G agarose beads. Viral DNA in input sera, protein A/G bead pulldown mixtures (beads), and the remaining supernatants (sup.) were extracted and subjected to Southern blot analysis. (D) Northern blot detection of serum viral RNA from patients 37, 38, 14, 35, 17, 21, 42, and 44. Total RNA were extracted from serum samples by TRIzol reagent and treated with DNase I before Northern blot analysis. (E to G) Southern blot analyses of viral DNA from selected samples. Viral DNA was separated by electrophoresis through TAE or alkaline agarose gels, followed by Southern blot detection with the indicated riboprobes.](zjv0241840640003){#F3}\n\nNorthern blot analyses showed that HBV RNA was only detected in serum samples from patients 17, 21, and 42 ([Fig. 3D](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Moreover, total viral DNA was analyzed by Southern blotting, and SS DNA was readily observed in serum samples from patients 17, 21, and 42 ([Fig. 3E](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). We also analyzed the lengths of DNA minus and plus strands in patients' sera. Despite the finding that most minus-strand DNA was complete, a small amount of viral DNA (that of patients 38, 35, 17, 21, and 42) was shorter than 3.2 knt ([Fig. 3F](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Compared with viral minus-strand DNA, the length of plus-strand DNA, particularly in sera from patients 17, 21, and 42, was more variable, ranging from shorter than 2 knt to \u223c3.2 knt ([Fig. 3G](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\nNaked capsids form CACs with anti-HBcAg antibody in blood of CHB patients. {#s2.3}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe showed that particles containing SS DNA were present in CHB patients' sera. To further examine these particles, we used CsCl density gradient centrifugation to fractionate a serum mixture from patients 37, 38, 14, and 35. In agreement with our earlier results ([Fig. 2A](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lower, fractions 13 to 15, and B) and previous reports, HBV virions, with the characteristic mature viral DNA (RC or DSL DNA), were detected in fractions 12 to 14 with densities between 1.26 and 1.29\u2009g/cm^3^ ([Fig. 4A](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}) ([@B2]). Careful inspection of the blots revealed that SS DNA could be detected, albeit at very low level, in fractions 8 and 9, with densities from 1.33 to 1.34\u2009g/cm^3^, and in fractions 18 to 21, with densities from 1.20 to 1.23\u2009g/cm^3^ ([Fig. 4A](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). In contrast, CsCl density gradient separation of viral particles from serum of patient 17 showed a mixture of mature and immature viral DNA species. As SS DNA was detected at densities ranging from 1.37 to 1.20\u2009g/cm^3^ ([Fig. 4B](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}), no distinct viral DNA (mature RC or DSL DNA) specific to virions could be identified at densities between 1.27 and 1.29\u2009g/cm^3^. Similar results were obtained using CsCl density gradient fractionation of sera from patient 21 (not shown) and patient 46 ([Fig. 4E](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n![CsCl density gradient analysis of hepatitis B viral particles. (A and B) CsCl density gradient analysis of viral particles in patient sera. One hundred-microliter volumes of serum mixture from patients 37, 38, 14, and 35 (25\u2009\u03bcl each) and 100\u2009\u03bcl serum from patient 17 were separated by CsCl density gradient centrifugation (2\u2009ml of 1.18 g/cm^3^ CsCl solution in the upper layer and 2.9\u2009ml of 1.33 g/cm^3^ CsCl solution in the lower layer). Viral DNA in each fraction was extracted and detected by Southern blotting. (C to G) CsCl density gradient analysis of viral particles treated with detergent or anti-HBcAg antibody (Ab). Concentrated HepAD38 cell culture supernatant (250\u2009\u03bcl each) (via ultrafiltration) was either mixed with anti-HBcAg antibody (10\u2009\u03bcl) followed by incubation without (C) or with NP-40 (final concentration, 1%) (D) for 1 h at room temperature and 4 h on ice or treated with only NP-40 (G) and then fractionated by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation. Sera from CHB patient 46 either left untreated (E) or treated with NP-40 (final concentration, 1%) (F) were fractionated by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation. Viral DNA in each fraction was extracted and subjected to Southern blot analyses.](zjv0241840640004){#F4}\n\nWe hypothesized that naked capsids could be released into blood circulation of CHB patients but were bound to specific antibodies. As SS DNA was detected in both high- and lower-density regions in CsCl gradient ([Fig. 4B](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [E](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}), we envisaged that the binding with specific antibodies led to a change of capsids' buoyant density. To test this, anti-HBcAg antibody was mixed with HepAD38 cell culture supernatant to mimic the postulated CACs in serum samples. The results demonstrated that in contrast to SS DNA from naked capsids, distributed to three fractions at densities between 1.33 and 1.34\u2009g/cm^3^ ([Fig. 2A](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lower, and B), the mixture of naked capsids and CACs (SS DNA) was distributed more widely and could be detected in the lower density region (1.25 to 1.32\u2009g/cm^3^) ([Fig. 4C](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}, fractions 11 to 16). Similarly, intracellular capsids from HepAD38 cells were incubated with anti-HBcAg antibody, and a density shift of CACs to a lower-density region was also observed (not shown). To further confirm the lower density of CACs, NCs in virions secreted to HepAD38 cell culture supernatant were treated with NP-40 and mixed with anti-HBcAg antibody. CsCl fractionation showed that naked capsids and virion-derived NCs have become a homogenous mixture banding at densities from 1.37 to 1.27\u2009g/cm^3^ ([Fig. 4D](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Likewise, virion-derived NCs, obtained by treatment of serum sample from patient 46 with NP-40 bound with antibody, further formed new homogeneous CACs that settled at densities between 1.23 and 1.27\u2009g/cm^3^ ([Fig. 4E](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"} versus F). However, NP-40 treatment alone did not produce a homogeneous mixture of naked capsids and virion-derived NCs, as these two particles still settled at distinct density regions with their characteristic viral DNA content ([Fig. 4G](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). On the other hand, DNA molecules in the two types of capsids still banded at densities between 1.38 and 1.31\u2009g/cm^3^, further confirming that CACs have relatively lighter density ([Fig. 4G](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\nAlternatively, the appearance of a homogenous mixture of virion-derived NCs and naked capsids ([Fig. 4D](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [F](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}) suggests the formation of higher-order antibody-mediated complexes of capsids. For instance, the complexes might not represent individual antibody-coated capsid particles but rather big CACs consisting of several capsid particles interconnected by antibodies. To verify whether intercapsid immune complexes exist, anti-HBcAg antibody was added to the purified HBV capsids expressed by Escherichia coli, and this mixture was examined by an electron microscope. E. coli-derived capsids were scattered as separate, distinct particles ([Fig. 5A](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}). However, addition of antibody caused capsids to aggregate into clusters, making them too thick to be properly stained ([Fig. 5B](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Despite this, a few capsids, which might not have been bound by antibodies or might have been associated with antibodies but did not form intercapsid antibody complexes, could be observed by electron microscopy (EM) ([Fig. 5B](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n![EM analysis of hepatitis B viral particles. (A and B) EM of E. coli-derived HBV capsids incubated without or with anti-HBcAg antibody. (C) EM of viral particles prepared from sera of CHB patients. Serum mixtures (obtained from patients 11, 22, 23, 27, 28, 30, and 41) depleted of HBsAg particles were negatively stained and examined with an electron microscope. The 42-nm HBV virions (arrowhead) and 27-nm naked capsids (arrow) are indicated, while the smaller 22-nm rods and spheres of HBsAg particles could also be observed but are not pointed out. Scale bars indicate 200\u2009nm or 500\u2009nm.](zjv0241840640005){#F5}\n\nWe then examined CACs in serum samples from CHB patients by EM. Sera from patients 11, 17, 21, 22, 23, 27, 28, 30, and 41, positive for SS DNA, were combined. Serum mixtures, with diminished HBsAg particles by centrifugation through a 20% and 45% (wt/wt) sucrose cushion, were examined by EM. The 27-nm capsid particles or CACs were visible ([Fig. 5C](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}, arrow) along with the 42-nm HBV virions ([Fig. 5C](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}, arrowheads) and the 22-nm spheres and rods of residual HBsAg particles (not indicated). However, the picture was not clear enough for us to conclusively determine if capsids were connected by or bound with antibodies, as described for unrelated virus in *in vitro* experiments ([@B35]). In addition, it is possible that some of the CACs are not visible by EM, as the complexes maybe too thick to gain clear contrast between lightly and heavily stained areas ([Fig. 5B](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\nLastly, CACs might be heterogeneous, having different molecular sizes and isoelectric points (pI) in hepatitis B patients' blood circulation. *In vitro* binding of naked capsids derived from HepAD38 cell culture supernatant with anti-HBcAg antibody changed their electrophoretic behavior and made them unable to enter the TAE-agarose gel ([Fig. 6A](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Moreover, viral particles from sera of patients 0, 37, 38, 14, 35, 17, 21, 42, and 44 could not enter agarose gels prepared in TAE buffer. However, in buffer with higher pH value (10\u2009mM NaCHO~3~, 3\u2009mM Na~2~CO~3~, pH 9.4), they appeared as smearing bands on blots ([Fig. 6B](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [C](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Hence, the irregular electrophoretic behavior of these viral particles may result from changes in molecular size and/or pI value of capsid particles (pI\u2009 4.4) following their association with specific immunoglobulin G (or other types of antibodies) having different pI values (pI of human IgG may range from 6.5 to 9.5) ([@B36][@B37][@B39]).\n\n![Native agarose gel analysis of viral particles in sera from hepatitis B patients. (A) Native agarose gel analysis of viral particles from HepAD38 cell culture supernatant. Ten microliters of HepAD38 cell culture supernatant (concentrated by ultrafiltration) incubated with or without anti-HBcAg antibody was resolved by native (TAE) agarose gel (0.8%) electrophoresis, followed by hybridization with minus-strand-specific riboprobe. (B and C) Native agarose gel analysis of viral particles from serum samples of hepatitis B patient in buffer with different pH values.

Sera from patients 37, 38, 14, 35, 17, 21, 42, and 44 (10\u2009\u03bcl each) were resolved by electrophoresis through 0.7% high-strength agarose (type IV agarose used for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) gels prepared in TAE (C, left) or carbonate buffer (C, right), followed by probe hybridization.](zjv0241840640006){#F6}\n\nCirculating HBV RNAs are of heterogeneous lengths and associated with CACs and virions in hepatitis B patient's plasma. {#s2.4}\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo characterize HBV RNAs circulating in CHB patients' sera, a plasma sample from patient 0 was studied. Similar to results obtained for patients 17, 21, and 46 ([Fig. 4B](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [E](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"} and not shown), viral DNA in the plasma sample of patient 0 was detected in a broad density range in CsCl gradient and no distinct bands specific to HBV virions or naked capsids could be identified, indicating the presence of a mixture of virions and CACs ([Fig. 7A](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n![Characterization of nucleic acid content within viral particles in plasma sample from patient 0. (A) CsCl density gradient analysis of plasma sample. Plasma from patient 0 was added directly with CsCl salt to a concentration of 21% (wt/wt) or 34% (wt/wt). Two milliliters of the 21% CsCl-plasma mixture was underlayered with 2.9\u2009ml 34% CsCl-plasma mixture, followed by ultracentrifugation. Viral DNA from each fraction was extracted and subjected to Southern blot analysis. (B) Sucrose gradient analysis of concentrated plasma sample. Five hundred microliters of concentrated plasma sample (via ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion) was fractionated in a 10% to 60% (wt/wt) sucrose gradient. PreS1 and HBsAg levels were determined by ELISA. Viral DNA and RNA were detected by Southern and Northern blotting with minus- or plus-strand-specific riboprobes. HBsAg, PreS1, and viral DNA and RNA (quantified from gray density of viral DNA/RNA bands, middle and lower) signals and sucrose density were plotted together. (C) Analysis of concentrated plasma sample with lower CsCl density gradient centrifugation. Two hundred fifty microliters of concentrated plasma sample was mixed with 2.2\u2009ml TNE buffer and 2.45\u2009ml of 37% (wt/wt) CsCl-TNE buffer (resulting in a homogenous CsCl solution with density of about 1.18 g/cm^3^), followed by ultracentrifugation. DNA in viral particle pellets (lane P) stuck to the sidewall of centrifugation tubes and was recovered by digesting with SDS-proteinase K solution. Viral DNA and RNA were subjected to Southern and Northern blot analyses. (D) Analysis of concentrated plasma sample with higher level of CsCl density gradient centrifugation. Two hundred fifty microliters of concentrated plasma sample was mixed with 1 ml of TNE buffer and 1.25\u2009ml of 37% (wt/wt) CsCl-TNE buffer and underlayered with 2.4\u2009ml of 27% (wt/wt) (1.25 g/cm^3^) CsCl-TNE solution, followed by ultracentrifugation. HBV DNA and RNA was detected by Southern and Northern blotting.](zjv0241840640007){#F7}\n\nFurthermore, viral particles were pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion and separated in a sucrose gradient. HBsAg was detected in fractions 5 to 14, peaking at fraction 11. The PreS1 antigen was found in fractions 5 to 12 with the peak at fractions 7 and 10, indicating its presence in HBsAg particles and HBV virions ([Fig. 7B](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}, upper). Viral DNA, representing a combination of both mature and immature viral DNA, was detected in fractions 4 to 9 ([Fig. 7B](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}, middle), suggesting the localization of CACs and virions in these fractions. HBV RNA was detected between fractions 5 and 7 and appeared in the same peak as viral DNA ([Fig. 7B](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lower), indicating that HBV RNA is incorporated in the same viral particles as viral DNA. Therefore, circulating HBV RNA may be localized within CACs and/or virions.\n\nTo better characterize HBV RNA in CACs and virions, plasma sample from patient 0 was centrifuged through a 20% sucrose cushion and pellets were fractionated in a homogenous CsCl solution (1.18\u2009g/cm^3^) as previously described ([@B8]). However, possibly due to a tendency of capsid particles to aggregate and stick to the wall of the centrifugation tube and the low density of the initial CsCl solution ([@B8], [@B40]), only mature DNA species from virions were detected in densities ranging from 1.22 to 1.24\u2009g/cm^3^ ([Fig. 7C](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}, upper). Northern blot analyses demonstrated that the lengths of virion-associated HBV RNAs were approximately several hundred nucleotides ([Fig. 7C](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lower). Virion-associated RNAs were unlikely to be contaminated by CAC-associated HBV RNAs, since the immature SS DNA could not be observed even after a long exposure of X ray film. Moreover, RNA molecules would have been longer if there were CAC contamination ([Fig. 7D](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lower). Viral nucleic acids in pellets recovered from the centrifugation tube sidewalls could be readily detected on Northern ([Fig. 7C](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lower, lane P) or Southern ([Fig. 7C](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}, upper, lane P) blots using plus-strand-specific rather than minus-strand-specific riboprobe.\n\nTo analyze viral nucleic acids in CACs, concentrated plasma sample was separated in a higher CsCl density gradient (1.18\u2009g/cm^3^ and 1.25\u2009g/cm^3^). Both mature and immature viral DNA species were only detected in fractions with densities from 1.21 to 1.26\u2009g/cm^3^ ([Fig. 7D](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}, upper), indicating the presence of a mixture of HBV virions and CACs. Viral RNAs were detected and ranged in length from a little shorter than the full-length pgRNA to a few hundred nucleotides ([Fig. 7D](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lower). Compared to virion-associated RNAs ([Fig. 7C](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lower), HBV RNA species detected in the mixture of CACs and virions were longer, with the longer RNA molecules possibly being associated with CACs.\n\nExtracellular HBV RNAs could serve as templates for synthesis of viral DNA. {#s2.5}\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIntracellular NCs are known to contain viral nucleic acids in all steps of DHBV DNA synthesis, including pgRNA, nascent minus-strand DNA, SS DNA, and RC DNA or DSL DNA ([@B5]). Our results showed that naked capsids contained almost the same DNA replicative intermediates as intracellular NCs ([Fig. 1B](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [2B](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}) ([@B7], [@B11]). We also demonstrated that extracellular HBV RNAs within the naked capsids, CACs, and virions were heterogeneous in length ([Fig. 1B](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lower, [2F](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}, and [7C](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [D](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}). In the presence of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), viral RNA could be degraded and reverse transcribed into minus-strand DNA by the endogenous polymerase *in vitro* ([@B5], [@B41], [@B42]). Also, incomplete plus-strand DNA with a gap of about 600 to 2,100 bases could be extended by endogenous polymerase ([@B43], [@B44]). Based on these results, we wished to examine whether extracellular HBV RNAs could serve as RNA templates for viral DNA synthesis and be degraded by polymerase in the process. As shown in [Fig. 8](#F8){ref-type=\"fig\"}, endogenous polymerase assay (EPA) treatment of extracellular viral particles from either culture supernatant of HepAD38 cells or plasma sample from patients led to DNA minus ([Fig. 8A](#F8){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [C](#F8){ref-type=\"fig\"})- and plus ([Fig. 8B](#F8){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [D](#F8){ref-type=\"fig\"})-strand extension and, more importantly, HBV RNA signal reduction ([Fig. 8E](#F8){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lane 4 versus 6 and lane 8 versus 10). The apparent low efficiency of EPA reaction might have been due to our hybridization method, which detected both extended and unextended DNA strands rather than detecting only newly extended DNA.\n\n![Analysis of extracellular HBV DNA and RNA by EPA. (A to D) Southern blot analysis of viral DNA strand elongation after EPA treatment. EPA was carried out employing HepAD38 cell culture supernatant and plasma sample from patient 0. Total nucleic acids were extracted via the SDS-proteinase K method. Viral DNA was separated by electrophoresis in TAE or alkaline agarose gels, followed by Southern blot analysis with minus- or plus-strand-specific riboprobes. (E) Northern blot analysis of viral RNA changed upon EPA treatment. Total viral nucleic acids (lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9) or RNA (treated with DNase I) (lanes 4, 6, 8, and 10) were separated by formaldehyde-MOPS agarose gel electrophoresis and subjected to Northern blotting.](zjv0241840640008){#F8}\n\nIn the process of HBV DNA replication, prior to minus-strand DNA synthesis, capsid-associated RNA is the full-length pgRNA. Upon transfer of viral polymerase-DNA primer to the 3\u2032 DR1 region of pgRNA and cleavage of the 3\u2032 epsilon loop RNA (a 3.2-knt pgRNA fragment remained), minus-strand DNA synthesis initiates and the pgRNA template is continuously cleaved from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 by RNase H activity of viral polymerase. Consequently, from the initiation to the completion of minus-strand DNA synthesis, there will be a series of pgRNA fragments with receding 3\u2032 ends ranging from 3.2 knt to 18\u2009nt of the 5\u2032 cap RNA primer ([@B2], [@B21][@B22][@B24]), representing the RNA templates that have not yet been reverse transcribed into minus-strand DNA. In addition to pgRNA with receding 3\u2032 ends, there are also short RNA fragments arising from intermittent nicks by the RNase H domain of polymerase. Therefore, we used RNA probes spanning the HBV genome to map whether these RNA molecules are present in extracellular naked capsids and virions.\n\nFive probes that spanned the HBV genome, except for the overlapping region between the 5\u2032 end of pgRNA and the RNA cleavage site (nt 1818 to 1930), were prepared to map the extracellular HBV RNAs from HepAD38 cell culture supernatant ([Fig. 9A](#F9){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Intracellular nucleocapsid-associated HBV RNA from HepAD38 cells was used as a reference. As the probes moved from the 5\u2032 end to 3\u2032 end of pgRNA, especially for probes 1 to 4, RNA bands shifted from a wider range, including both short and long RNA species, to a narrower range, close to full-length pgRNA, with fewer RNA species detected ([Fig. 9A](#F9){ref-type=\"fig\"}, upper, lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and 17). Similarly, with the probes moving from the 5\u2032 end to the 3\u2032 end of pgRNA, a stronger intensity band representing extracellular HBV RNAs detected by each probe, especially for probes 1 to 4, was also shifting toward a longer RNA migration region ([Fig. 9A](#F9){ref-type=\"fig\"}, upper, lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18). It should be noted that the shifting pattern was more apparent when RNAs were detected with probes 1 to 4 but not with probe 5. It is possible that the reverse transcription speed is relatively quicker in the initial step (from the 3\u2032 end of pgRNA, which overlaps the probe 5 sequence), and as a result, fewer pgRNA fragments will harbor RNA sequence for probe 5. Also, a short RNA species from either intracellular nucelocapsids or naked capsids and virions migrated faster than 0.7 knt and could be detected by all probes ([Fig. 9A](#F9){ref-type=\"fig\"}, upper, lanes 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 18). These RNA molecules likely represent the pgRNA fragments that have been hydrolyzed by the RNase H domain of viral polymerase (including the 3\u2032 epsilon loop RNA cleaved by polymerase in the reverse transcription step) ([@B24]). Collectively, as predicted, longer extracellular HBV RNA species that migrated slower and closer to the position of pgRNA had longer 3\u2032 ends, the shorter viral RNA molecules that migrated faster had relatively shorter 3\u2032 ends, and the RNA species detected by all probes may represent products of pgRNA hydrolysis.\n\n![Mapping and identifying 3\u2032 ends of extracellular HBV RNAs. (A) Northern blot detection of extracellular HBV RNAs with various riboprobes. Viral RNA from cytoplasmic (C) nucleocapsids (lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and 17) or culture supernatant (S) (lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18) of HepAD38 cells was extracted with TRIzol reagent and treated with DNase I before Northern blot analysis with plus-strand-specific riboprobes spanning the HBV genome as indicated. pgRNA was used as a reference, and map coordinates were numbered according to the sequence of the HBV genome (genotype D, accession number [AJ344117.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AJ344117.1)). (B) Identification of 3\u2032 ends of extracellular HBV RNAs. 3\u2032 Ends of extracellular HBV RNAs were identified by the 3\u2032 RACE method using different HBV-specific anchor primers (the same 5\u2032 primers used for generating templates for producing riboprobes used in panel A, lower). Identified 3\u2032 ends were numbered as described above, and numbers in parentheses indicate the amount of clones with the same 3\u2032 ends. The asterisk indicates unknown nucleic acid copurified with intracellular capsid-associated viral RNA by TRIzol reagent.

Various 3\u2032 ends spanning the HBV genome were identified ([Fig. 9B](#F9){ref-type=\"fig\"}), validating the presence of 3\u2032 receding RNA and the heterogeneous nature of extracellular HBV RNAs.\n\nEPA treatment clearly demonstrated that extracellular HBV RNAs could be used as templates for DNA synthesis, and the presence of 3\u2032 receding-end pgRNA fragments further confirmed not only the existence but also the use of such molecules as templates for viral DNA synthesis. Therefore, just like the viral RNA counterpart within intracellular NCs, extracellular HBV RNA molecules represent the RNA molecules generated in the process of viral DNA replication.\n\nETV reduces viral DNA level but increases extracellular HBV RNA level in naked capsids and virions *in vitro*. {#s2.6}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEntecavir (ETV), widely used in anti-HBV therapy, is a deoxyguanosine analog that blocks the reverse transcription and plus-strand DNA synthesis steps in the HBV DNA replication process ([@B45][@B46][@B47]). Treatment of CHB patients with nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs), including entecavir, efficiently reduces the level of serum viral DNA but at the same time increases circulating HBV RNA levels ([@B28], [@B48][@B49][@B52]). We examined the effect of entecavir on the levels of both intracellular and extracellular viral nucleic acids in HepAD38 cell culture.\n\nTotal viral RNA level remained unchanged or marginally increased upon entecavir treatment ([Fig. 10A](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"}), and the intracellular capsid-associated viral RNA level was increased ([Fig. 10B](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"}, upper). In contrast and as expected, the intracellular capsid-associated viral DNA level was decreased ([Fig. 10B](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lower). Similarly, extracellular viral DNA synthesis was significantly inhibited, while viral RNA was increased ([Fig. 10C](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [D](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Quantitative results showed that entecavir suppressed extracellular viral DNA to about one-tenth but at the same time increased viral RNA by about twofold the level for the untreated group ([Fig. 10E](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n![Analysis of HBV DNA and RNA change upon entecavir treatment of HepAD38 cells. (A) Change of total cellular HBV RNA level upon entecavir (ETV) treatment. HepAD38 cells were treated with ETV (0.1\u2009\u03bcM) for 4\u2009days, and total cellular RNA was analyzed by Northern blotting with ribosomal RNAs serving as loading controls. (B) Change of intracellular nucleocapsid-associated viral RNA (core RNA) and DNA (core DNA) level after ETV treatment. Cytoplasmic core RNA was extracted by the SDS-proteinase K method and analyzed by Northern blotting. Intracellular nucleocapsids were first separated by native agarose gel electrophoresis, and capsid-associated viral DNA (core DNA) was then probed with minus-strand-specific riboprobe. (C to E) Change of extracellular HBV DNA and RNA level upon ETV treatment.

(F to H) CsCl density gradient analysis of viral DNA/RNA level in naked capsids and virions after ETV treatment. HepAD38 cells were left untreated or were treated with ETV, and culture media were concentrated by ultrafiltration, followed by fractionation in CsCl density gradients as described in the legend to [Fig. 4](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}. Viral particles in each fraction were separated by native agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting with anti-HBcAg antibody. Viral DNA and RNA were extracted and subjected to Southern or Northern blot analyses.](zjv0241840640010){#F10}\n\nSince viral DNA and RNA were enclosed in both naked capsids and virions, CsCl density gradient was used to separate these particles and to further study the antiviral effect of entecavir. As shown in [Fig. 10](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"}, DNA-containing naked capsids were detected in fractions 6 to 11 and virions in fractions 15 to 24 ([Fig. 10F](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Entecavir effectively reduced viral DNA ([Fig. 10G](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"}, fractions 6 to 10 and 15 to 17; this was also seen in a longer exposure of [Fig. 10G](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"} \\[not shown\\]) but increased viral RNA content mainly in naked capsids ([Fig. 10H](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"}, fractions 6 to 9). Moreover, the increase in RNA content within naked capsids led to an increased density of naked capsids ([Fig. 10F](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"}, fractions 6 and 11, lower, versus fractions 6 and 11, upper). Interestingly, entecavir seemed to reduce HBcAg signal within virions (i.e., empty virions) ([Fig. 10F](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"}, fractions 15 to 21, upper, versus fractions 15 to 21, lower) while increasing the egress of naked capsids from HepAD38 cells (data not shown).\n\nDISCUSSION {#s3}\n==========\n\nThe RNA molecules in either intracellular NCs or extracellular virions were reported more than three decades ago ([@B5], [@B41], [@B42]), and naked capsids were shown to carry pgRNA *in vitro* ([@B9], [@B11]). Recently, it was suggested that the extracellular or circulating HBV RNA could serve as a surrogate marker to evaluate the endpoint of hepatitis B treatment ([@B27], [@B30], [@B48][@B49][@B53]). With this in mind and to facilitate its application as a novel biomarker for viral persistence, we studied the origin and characteristics of extracellular HBV RNA.\n\nIn the present study, we extensively characterized extracellular HBV RNAs and demonstrated that extracellular HBV RNAs were mainly enclosed in naked capsids rather than complete virions in supernatant of HepAD38 cells ([Fig. 1B](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [2F](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). These RNAs were of heterogeneous lengths, ranging from full-length pgRNA (3.5 knt) to a few hundred nucleotides. Furthermore, circulating HBV RNAs, also heterogeneous in length, were detected in blood of hepatitis B patients ([Fig. 3D](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [7C](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [D](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Interestingly, the detection of HBV RNAs coincided with the presence of immature HBV DNA ([Fig. 3D](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [E](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Isopycnic CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation of RNA positive serum samples exhibited a broad range of distribution of immature HBV DNA, which contrasted with the results obtained in HepAD38 cells ([Fig. 2B](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"} versus [@B4]B and E, [@B7]A). For the first time, we provided convincing evidence that unenveloped capsids containing the full spectrum of HBV replication intermediates and RNA species that are heterogeneous in length could be detected in the circulation of chronic hepatitis B patients.\n\nIn view of our results and literature reports ([@B2], [@B21][@B22][@B24]), the presence of extracellular HBV RNAs could easily be interpreted in the context of the HBV DNA replication model ([Fig. 11A](#F11){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Since naked capsids contain viral DNA at all maturation levels, they will also carry HBV RNA molecules originating from pgRNA, including full-length pgRNA prior to minus-strand DNA synthesis, pgRNA with 3\u2032 receding ends, and the pgRNA hydrolysis fragments. On the other hand, virions that contain only mature forms of viral DNA species would likely bear only the hydrolyzed short RNA fragments remaining in the nucleocapsid ([@B43]). Likewise, the HBV RNA species found in CACs are longer than those in virions in sera of hepatitis B patients ([Fig. 7D](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lower, versus C, lower). In line with this reasoning, treatment of HepAD38 cells with entecavir reduced viral DNA in naked capsids and virions ([Fig. 10C](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"}, [E](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"}, and [G](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"}) but at the same time increased HBV RNA content within naked capsids ([Fig. 10H](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"}). This may be a result of the stalled activity of viral RT with concomitant shutdown of RNA hydrolysis ([@B46], [@B54]).\n\n![Models for the content of extracellular HBV RNAs and the formation of circulating CACs. (A) HBV RNA molecules present in the process of DNA synthesis. HBV RNAs are included in the following DNA synthesis steps: 1, encapsidation of full-length pgRNA into NCs; 2, transfer of polymerase-DNA primer to the 3\u2032 DR1 region and initiation of minus-strand DNA synthesis (3\u2032 epsilon loop of pgRNA will be cleaved by RNase H domain of polymerase); 3, elongation of minus-strand DNA. With the extension of minus-strand DNA, pgRNA will be continuously cleaved from the 3\u2032 end, generating pgRNA fragments with receding 3\u2032 ends and pgRNA hydrolysis fragments. (B) Possible forms of circulating CACs. Intracellular NCs with pgRNA or pgRNA fragment and DNA replicative intermediates released into blood circulation of CHB patients are bound with specific antibodies (IgG), forming various forms of CACs.](zjv0241840640011){#F11}\n\nContrary to a recent report claiming that the pgRNA-containing NCs can be enveloped and secreted as virions ([@B27]), we clearly demonstrated that secreted naked capsids carry the majority of HBV RNAs ([Fig. 1B](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [2F](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and that virion-associated RNAs are approximately several hundred nucleotides long ([Fig. 1B](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [7C](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Our results are consistent with earlier reports demonstrating that only mature nucleocapsids with RC/DSL DNA are enveloped and secreted as virions ([@B6][@B7][@B8], [@B11]), and under this condition, virions carry only short RNase H-cleaved pgRNA ([Fig. 11A](#F11){ref-type=\"fig\"}, step 3).\n\nIn this research, we were unable to separate hydrolyzed pgRNA fragments from the pgRNA and pgRNA with 3\u2032 receding ends. Thus, the length of these RNA molecules could not be determined. The existence of hydrolyzed RNA products during reverse transcription is not without precedent. In some retroviruses, DNA polymerization speed of RT is greater than the RNA hydrolysis speed of RNase H, thus hydrolysis of RNA template is often incomplete ([@B55], [@B56]). For example, RT of avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) hydrolyzed RNA template once for every 100 to 200 nt, while cleavage frequency of RTs of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) appeared to be around 100 to 120 nt ([@B57]). Moreover, RNA secondary structures, such as hairpins, may stall the RT activity promoting RNase H cleavage, producing shorter RNA fragments ([@B55], [@B56]).\n\nFurthermore, the cleaved RNA fragments may not disassociate but anneal to the nascent minus-strand DNA forming the DNA-RNA hybrids until they are displaced by plus-strand DNA synthesis ([@B55], [@B56]). Although similar studies on HBV replication were hampered by lack of fully functional viral polymerase *in vitro* ([@B58][@B59][@B61]), the reported presence of DNA-RNA hybrid molecules clearly indicated the existence of degraded pgRNA fragments that still annealed to the minus-strand DNA ([@B5], [@B41], [@B42], [@B62]). Consistent with a previous study, our results also showed that at least part of the SS DNA is associated with RNA molecules as the DNA-RNA hybrid molecules, as detected by either RNase H digestion or the cesium sulfate density gradient separation method ([@B5] and data not shown).\n\nGiven the fact that HBV RNA and immature HBV DNA are packaged in naked capsids ([Fig. 1B](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [2B](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [F](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}) ([@B11]), we postulated that, in CHB patients, unenveloped capsids are released into circulation, where they rapidly form CACs with anti-HBcAg antibodies ([Fig. 11B](#F11){ref-type=\"fig\"}) ([@B25], [@B33], [@B34]). In support of this notion, we showed that protein A/G agarose beads could specifically pull down particles with mature and immature HBV DNA from sera of CHB patients, implying the involvement of antibody. Addition of anti-HBcAg antibody to HepAD38 cell culture supernatant led to a shift of naked capsids' buoyant density to lower-density regions ([Fig. 4C](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [D](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}), a pattern similar to that obtained in HBV RNA-positive serum samples ([Fig. 4B](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [E](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}, and [7A](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}). These particles exhibited heterogeneous electrophoretic behavior that differed from that of particles in HepAD38 culture supernatant, suggesting that they are not individual naked capsid particles but are associated with antibodies and have nonuniform compositions ([Fig. 6](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [11B](#F11){ref-type=\"fig\"}) ([@B36][@B37][@B38]). In CHB patients, the high titers of anti-HBcAg antibodies, which exceed 10,000\u2009IU/ml, preclude circulation of antibody-unbound naked capsids ([@B63]). Indeed, the excessive amounts of anti-HBcAg antibodies present in the plasma sample of patient 0 were able to pull down naked capsids from the culture supernatant of HepAD38 cells (not shown).\n\nWe have demonstrated the presence of circulating CACs as the new form of naked capsids in CHB patients. It is known that naked capsid particles can be secreted either by the natural endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway ([@B15][@B16][@B17]) or possibly by cell lysis consequent to liver inflammation. Our preliminary clinical data (not shown) are in agreement with a recent study showing an association of circulating HBV RNA with serum ALT level ([@B64]). However, this connection can be interpreted in a different manner, as the capsid-antibody complexes might constitute a danger signal triggering inflammation. Interestingly, the release of naked capsids seems to be an intrinsic property of hepadnaviruses preserved through evolution. Recent studies by Lauber et al. provided evidence as to the ancient origin of HBV descending from nonenveloped progenitors in fish, with their envelope protein gene emerging *de novo* much later ([@B65]). Thus, it is reasonable to propose that the active release of HBV capsid particles should be deemed a natural course of viral egress.\n\nApart from HBV particles, it was also reported that exosomes could serve as HBV DNA or RNA carriers ([@B29], [@B66], [@B67]). However, HBV DNA and RNA was detected in naked capsids or CACs and virion fractions rather than in lower-density regions where membrane vesicles like HBsAg particles (density of 1.18\u2009g/cm^3^) and exosomes (density of 1.10 to 1.18\u2009g/cm^3^) would likely settle ([@B2], [@B27], [@B48], [@B68], [@B69]) ([Fig. 1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [7B](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}). As a result, it is not likely that exosomes serve as the main vehicles carrying HBV DNA or RNA molecules.\n\nNumerous pieces of data showed that HBV spliced RNAs also represent a species of extracellular HBV RNAs ([@B28], [@B70], [@B71]). However, in HepAD38 cells, as most of the RNAs are transcribed from the integrated HBV sequence other than the cccDNA template, pgRNA packaged into nucleocapsids is the predominant RNA molecule ([Fig. 9A](#F9){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [10D](#F10){ref-type=\"fig\"}), and viral DNA derived from pgRNA is the dominant DNA form ([Fig. 2D](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [E](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"} and data not shown). For the same reason, it would be difficult for us to estimate the amount of spliced HBV RNAs in clinical samples.\n\nAlthough we could not completely rule out the possibility that HBV RNAs are released into blood circulation by association with other vehicles or other pathways, it is possible that the spliced HBV RNAs also egress out of cells in naked capsids and virions like the pgRNA.\n\nIn summary, we demonstrated that extracellular HBV RNA molecules are pgRNA and degraded pgRNA fragments generated in the HBV replication process *in vitro*. Moreover, we provided evidence that HBV RNAs exist in the form of CACs in hepatitis B patients' blood circulation. More importantly, the association of circulating HBV RNAs with CACs or virions in hepatitis B patients suggests their pgRNA origin. Hence, our results here suggest the circulating HBV RNAs within CACs or virions in hepatitis B patients could serve as novel biomarkers to assess efficacy of treatment.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS {#s4}\n=====================\n\nCell culture. {#s4.1}\n-------------\n\nHepAD38 cells that replicate HBV in a tetracycline-repressible manner were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)-F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and doxycycline was withdrawn to allow virus replication ([@B31]).\n\nPatients and samples. {#s4.2}\n---------------------\n\nSerum samples from 45 chronic hepatitis B patients with HBV DNA titer higher than 10^7^\u2009IU per ml were randomly selected.

{#s4.3}\n-----------------\n\nAll samples from HBV-infected patients used in this study were from an already-existing collection supported by the National Science and Technology Major Project of China (grant no. 2012ZX10002007-001). Written informed consent was received from participants prior to collection of clinical samples ([@B72]). Samples used in this study were anonymized before analysis. This study was conducted in compliance with the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center.\n\nPreparation of viral particles. {#s4.4}\n-------------------------------\n\nHepAD38 cell culture supernatant was mixed with polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000) to a final concentration of 10% (wt/vol) and incubated on ice for at least 1\u2009h, followed by centrifugation at 925\u2009\u00d7 *g* for 20\u2009min. Pellets were suspended in TNE buffer (10\u2009mM Tris-Cl \\[pH 7.5\\], 100\u2009mM NaCl, and 1\u2009mM EDTA) containing 0.05% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol to 1/150 of the original volume, followed by a brief sonication ([@B73], [@B74]). Alternatively, viral particles in HepAD38 cell culture supernatant were concentrated 50- to 100-fold by ultrafiltration using a filter unit (Amicon Ultra-15, 100 kDa).\n\nPlasma samples from patient 0 were centrifuged through a 20% (wt/vol) sucrose cushion at 26,000\u2009rpm for 16\u2009h in an SW 32 Ti rotor (Beckman), and pellets were resuspended in 1/200 the original volume of TNE buffer and sonicated briefly ([@B75]).\n\nSamples prepared using methods described above were either used immediately or aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for later use.\n\nSucrose density gradient centrifugation. {#s4.5}\n----------------------------------------\n\nHepAD38 cells culture supernatant concentrated by PEG 8000 was centrifugation at 500\u2009\u00d7 *g* for 5\u2009min to remove aggregates. Ten percent, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60% (wt/wt) sucrose gradients were prepared by underlayering and incubated for 4\u2009h in a water bath at room temperature to allow gradient to become continuous. Five hundred microliters of concentrated sample was layered over the gradient and centrifuged at 34,100\u2009rpm for 14\u2009h at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman SW 41 Ti rotor. Fractions were collected from top to bottom, and the density of each fraction was determined by refractometry ([@B10]). Fractions containing viral particles were subjected to native agarose gel analysis, and HBsAg level was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Shanghai Kehua).\n\nCesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. {#s4.6}\n------------------------------------------------\n\nHepAD38 cell culture supernatant (1.5\u2009ml), concentrated by ultrafiltration, or serum samples from chronic hepatitis patients diluted with TNE buffer to 1.5\u2009ml were mixed with equal volumes of 37% (wt/wt) CsCl-TNE buffer (1.377\u2009g/cm^3^) and underlayered with 1.9\u2009ml 34% (wt/wt) CsCl-TNE buffer (1.336\u2009g/cm^3^), followed by centrifugation at 90,000\u2009rpm at 4\u00b0C for 12\u2009h (Beckman VTi 90 rotor) ([@B8]). The tube was punctured from the bottom, and every six to seven drops were collected as one fraction. Densities of separated fractions were determined by weighing. Each fraction was then desalted against TNE buffer by ultrafiltration, followed by native agarose gel separation or nucleic acid extraction.\n\nAll of the CsCl density gradient centrifugation experiments were carried out at 90,000\u2009rpm at 4\u00b0C for 12\u2009h in a Beckman VTi 90 rotor.\n\nNative agarose gel analysis of viral particles and capsid-associated DNA. {#s4.7}\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nViral particles were resolved by native agarose gel (0.8% agarose gel prepared in Tris-acetate-EDTA \\[TAE\\] buffer) electrophoresis and transferred in TNE buffer to either a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45\u2009\u03bcM) for detection of viral antigens with specific antibodies or a nylon membrane for Southern blot analysis of viral DNA. For viral antigens detection, the membrane was first fixed as previously described ([@B74]), and HBV core antigen was detected by anti-HBcAg antibody (Dako) (1:5,000). The same membrane then was soaked in stripping buffer (200\u2009mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, 1% Tween 20, pH 2.2) and reprobed with anti-HBsAg antibody (Shanghai Kehua) (1:5,000). For Southern blot analysis of viral DNA, the membrane was dipped in denaturing buffer (0.5\u2009N NaOH, 1.5\u2009M NaCl) for 10\u2009s and immediately neutralized in 1\u2009M Tris-Cl (pH 7.0)--1.5 M NaCl for 1\u2009min, followed by hybridization with minus-strand-specific riboprobe ([@B76]).\n\nViral nucleic acid extraction, separation, and detection. {#s4.8}\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(I) Nucleic acid extraction.** To extract total viral nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), the SDS-proteinase K method was used ([@B77]). Samples were digested in solution containing 1% SDS, 15\u2009mM EDTA, and 0.5\u2009mg/ml proteinase K at 37\u00b0C for 15\u2009min. The digestion mixture was extracted twice with phenol and once with chloroform. Aqueous supernatant were added with 1/9 volume of 3\u2009M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 40\u2009\u03bcg of glycogen and precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol.\n\nIn addition to the SDS-proteinase K method, viral RNA was also extracted with TRIzol LS reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\nTo isolate intracellular capsid-associated viral RNA, HepAD38 cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-Cl \\[pH 7.8\\], 1\u2009mM EDTA, 1% NP-40), and cytoplasmic lysates were incubated with CaCl~2~ (final concentration, 5\u2009mM) and micrococcal nuclease (MNase) (Roche) (final concentration, 15\u2009U/ml) at 37\u00b0C for 1\u2009h to remove nucleic acids outside nucleocapsids. The reaction was terminated by addition of EDTA (final concentration, 15\u2009mM), and then proteinase K (0.5\u2009mg/ml without SDS) was added to the mixture, followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min to inactivate MNase. Viral nucleic acids were released by addition of SDS to a final concentration of 1% and extracted as described above.\n\n**II. Separation. (i) TAE agarose gel.** Viral DNA was resolved by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel in 1\u00d7 TAE buffer, followed by denaturation in 0.5\u2009M NaOH--1.5 M NaCl for 30\u2009min and neutralization with 1\u2009M Tris-Cl (pH 7.0)--1.5 M NaCl for 30\u2009min.\n\n**(ii) Alkaline agarose gel.** Viral DNA was denatured with a 0.1 volume of solution containing 0.5\u2009M NaOH and 10\u2009mM EDTA and resolved overnight at 1.5\u2009V/cm in a 1.5% agarose gel with 50\u2009mM NaOH and 1\u2009mM EDTA. After electrophoresis, the gel was neutralized with 1\u2009M Tris-Cl (pH 7.0)--1.5 M NaCl for 45 min ([@B78]).\n\n**(iii) Formaldehyde-MOPS agarose gel.** Viral RNA was obtained by treatment of total nucleic acids extracted using the above-described SDS-proteinase K method with RNase free DNase I (Roche) for 15\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. The reaction was stopped by addition of equal amounts of 2\u00d7 RNA loading buffer (95% formamide, 0.025% SDS, 0.025% bromophenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol FF, and 1\u2009mM EDTA) supplemented with extra EDTA (20\u2009mM), followed by denaturing at 65\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. Viral RNA extracted by TRIzol LS reagent was mixed with 2\u00d7\u2009RNA loading buffer and denatured. Denatured mixtures were separated by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel containing 2% (vol/vol) formaldehyde solution (37%) and 1\u00d7\u2009MOPS (3-\\[N-morpholino\\]propanesulfonic acid) buffer.\n\nThe gels described above were balanced in 20\u00d7\u2009SSC solution (1\u00d7\u2009SSC is 0.15\u2009M NaCl and 0.015\u2009M sodium citrate, pH 7.0) for 20\u2009min, and viral nucleic acids were transferred onto nylon membranes overnight with 20\u00d7\u2009SSC buffer.\n\nIII. Detection. {#s4.10}\n---------------\n\nDigoxigenin-labeled riboprobes used for detection of HBV DNA and RNA were prepared by *in vitro* transcription of a pcDNA3 plasmid that harbors 3,215\u2009bp of HBV DNA (nt 1814 to 1813) by following the vendor's suggestions (12039672910; Roche). Riboprobes used for HBV RNA mapping were transcribed from DNA templates generated by PCR by incorporating T7 promoter into the 5\u2032 end of reversed primers ([Fig. 9A](#F9){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\nHybridization was carried out at 50\u00b0C overnight, followed by two 5-min washes in 2\u00d7\u2009SSC--0.1% SDS at room temperature and two additional 15-min washes in 0.1\u00d7\u2009SSC--0.1% SDS at 50\u00b0C. The membrane was sequentially incubated with blocking buffer and anti-digoxigenin-AP Fab fragment (Roche) at 20\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. Subsequently, the membrane was washed twice with washing buffer (100\u2009mM maleic acid, 150\u2009mM NaCl, and 0.3% Tween 20, pH 7.5) for 15\u2009min, followed by detection with diluted CDP-Star substrate (ABI) and exposure to X-ray film.\n\nProtein A/G agarose bead pulldown of antibody-antigen complexes. {#s4.11}\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTwo hundred microliters of serum sample was first mixed with 300\u2009\u03bcl of TNE buffer, and then 15\u2009\u03bcl of protein A/G agarose bead slurry (Santa Cruz) was added to the mixture, followed by incubation overnight at 4\u00b0C in a sample mixer. Subsequently, protein A/G agarose beads were washed three times with TNE buffer, and viral DNA in input serum samples (40\u2009\u03bcl) and agarose bead pulldown mixtures were extracted and subjected to Southern blot analysis.\n\nEM. {#s4.12}\n---\n\nSerum samples from patients 11, 17, 21 22, 23, 27, 28, 30, and 41 were pooled (200\u2009\u03bcl each) and mixed with 200\u2009\u03bcl of 20% (wt/wt) sucrose. Serum mixtures were centrifuged through 2 ml of 20% (wt/wt) and 2 ml of 45% (wt/wt) (1.203\u2009g/cm^3^) sucrose cushions at 34,100\u2009rpm for 8\u2009h at 4\u00b0C in an SW 41 Ti rotor (Beckman) to remove HBsAg particles. Supernatants were decanted and the centrifugation tube was placed upside down for 20\u2009s, and residue sucrose was wiped out. One milliliter of phosphate buffer (10\u2009mM Na~2~HPO~4~, 1.8\u2009mM KH~2~PO~4~, and no NaCl) (pH 7.4) was added, and the bottom of the tube was gently washed without disturbing the pellet. A volume of 11.5\u2009ml of phosphate buffer then was added into the tube and centrifuged again at 34,100\u2009rpm for 3\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in a drop of distilled water and dropped onto a carbon-coated copper grid, followed by staining with 2% phosphotungstic acid (pH 6.1) and examining in an electron microscope (Philip CM120) ([@B13], [@B79]).\n\nViral DNA and RNA quantification. {#s4.13}\n---------------------------------\n\nViral DNA used for quantification was extracted using the SDS-proteinase K method as described above. Viral RNAs were extracted by TRIzol LS reagent, and DNase I was used to remove the remaining DNA, followed by phenol and chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Reverse transcription was carried out using Maxima H minus reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a specific primer (AGATCTTCKGCGACGCGG \\[nt 2428 to 2411\\]) according to the manufacturer's guidelines, except the 65\u00b0C incubation step was skipped to avoid RNA degradation. To ensure removal of viral DNA signal (below 1,000 copies per reaction), a mock reverse transcription, without addition of reverse transcriptase, was carried out. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was carried out using Thunderbird SYBR qPCR mix (Toyobo) in a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (ABI). Primer pairs (F, GGRGTGTGGATTCGCAC \\[nt 2267 to 2283\\]; R, AGATCTTCKGCGACGCGG \\[nt 2428 to 2411\\]) conserved among all HBV genotypes and close to the 5\u2032 end but not in the overlap region between the start codon and the poly(A) cleavage site of pgRNA were chosen. The cycling conditions were 95\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5\u2009s, 57\u00b0C for 20\u2009s, and 72\u00b0C for 30\u2009s. DNA fragment containing 3,215 bp of full-length HBV DNA was released from plasmid by restriction enzymes, and DNA standards were prepared according to a formula in which 1\u2009pg of DNA equals 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910^5^ copies of viral DNA.\n\nEPA. {#s4.14}\n----\n\nHepAD38 cell culture supernatant or plasma from patient 0 were concentrated as described above and mixed with equal volumes of 2\u00d7\u2009EPA buffer (100\u2009mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 80\u2009mM NH~4~Cl, 40\u2009mM MgCl~2~, 2% NP-40, and 0.6% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) with or without dNTPs (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, each at a final concentration of 100\u2009\u03bcM) ([@B80]). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2\u2009h and stopped by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 15\u2009mM.\n\n3\u2032 RACE. {#s4.15}\n--------\n\nConcentrated HepAD38 cell culture supernatant (by ultrafiltration) was digested with MNase in the presence of NP-40 (final concentration, 1%) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. EDTA (final concentration, 15\u2009mM) and proteinase K (final concentration, 0.5\u2009mg/ml) were then added and incubated for another 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C. Viral nucleic acids were extracted with TRIzol LS reagent followed by DNase I treatment to remove residue viral DNA. Poly(A) tails were added to the 3\u2032 end of HBV RNA by E. coli poly(A) polymerase (NEB). The preincubation step at 65\u00b0C for 5\u2009min was omitted to reduce potential RNA degradation, and reverse transcription was carried out with Maxima H minus reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific) using an oligo-dT(29)-SfiI(A)-adaptor primer (5\u2032-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCATTACGGCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3\u2032) in reverse transcription buffer \\[1\u00d7\u2009RT buffer, RNase inhibitor, 1\u2009M betanine, 0.5\u2009mM each dNTP, and 5\u2009\u03bcM of oligo-dT(29)-SfiI(A)-adaptor primer\\] at 50\u00b0C for 90\u2009min, followed by heating at 85\u00b0C for 5\u2009min and treatment with RNase H at 37\u00b0C for 15\u2009min. PCR amplification of cDNA fragments was then performed with 5\u2032 HBV-specific primers \\[the same sequences of forward primers used for riboprobe preparation ([Fig. 9A](#F9){ref-type=\"fig\"}), except each primer containing a flanking sequence plus a SfiI(B) site (5\u2032-AGTGATGGCCGAGGCGGCC-3\u2032)\\] and 3\u2032 adaptor primer (5\u2032-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTG-3\u2032). The reaction was carried out with PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase (TaKaRa) at 95\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, followed by 5 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 5\u2009s, 50\u00b0C for 10\u2009s, and 72\u00b0C for 210\u2009s, 35 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 5\u2009s, 55\u00b0C for 10\u2009s, and 72\u00b0C for 210\u2009s, and a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. PCR amplicons were digested with SfiI enzyme and cloned into pV1-Blasticidin vector (kind gift from Zhigang Yi, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University). Positive clones were identified by sequencing, and only clones with 3\u2032 poly(dA) sequence were considered authentic viral RNA 3\u2032 ends.\n\nWe thank Zhuying Chen and Xiurong Peng for handling serum samples and compiling the clinical data used in this research.\n\nThis research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (81671998, 91542207), National Key Research and Development Program (2016YFC0100604), National Science and Technology Major Project of China (2017ZX10302201001005), Shanghai Science and Technology Commission (16411960100), and Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (2017-01-07-00-07-E00057).\n\n[^1]: **Citation** Bai L, Zhang X, Kozlowski M, Li W, Wu M, Liu J, Chen L, Zhang J, Huang Y, Yuan Z. 2018.

{"text": "Q:\n\nWhere to get flight dynamics for a flight sim model?\n\nOnce, a while ago, I tried to create a Flight Simulator X model for an aircraft that I wanted a model of, but was soon overwhelmed by having to guess so much of the flight dynamics. Is there somewhere where I could get detailed information about the flight dynamics of aircraft without contacting the manufacturer, a pilot, or having the plane itself to run tests on? I mean for things like drag at different mach, drag coefficient created by the landing gear, lift coefficient created by the flaps, detailed stuff about the engines, etc.\n\nA:\n\nUnfortunately I have no experience with how FSX models aircraft, but at a guess, it's model requires extensive experimental data from a real aircraft to truly get the right parameters.\nAnd that's something no hobbyist is likely to be able to do. For that matter, it's pretty difficult for a pilot to do, since actually recording the relevant data is difficult, and some of what you need to know requires doing things with the aircraft you probably shouldn't do in most circumstances.\nX-Plane's flight model and aircraft creation tool is far more forgiving. You still end up having to guess a lot of parameters, but they are generally less critical to basic handling.\nAll you really need to get a decent flight model out of X-Plane is a good set of reverence pictures, an eye for detail (so your model matches the geometry properly), and ideally the correct airfoil profiles and engine specifications.\n(Primarily the thrust and power)\nFor the most part, good reference models and diagrams, and the information you'd find in the Pilot's operating handbook is enough to create a decent flight model in X-Plane.\nIt certainly won't be perfect, and you'll probably have to tune it, but it's a much easier task than getting that data needed for an FSX model.\nI have the good fortune of being a student pilot, and as such I decided to attempt a model in X-Plane, and found that while it was far from perfect, (and needs a lot of improvement to be a 'good') model, it's behaviour was much closer to the real aircraft that I fly regularly than I was ever expecting given how much I had to guess.\nI had to guess everything from the aileron deflection angles to the propeller geometry, wing airfoil choices and more, and still the resulting model was only slightly off from the real thing insofar as I know how the real aircraft flies.\nI guess that's not an overly helpful answer in a direct sense for an FSX flight model, but I fear it just isn't going to be at all easy to find the information you need to make a flight model that isn't fundamentally broken in FSX, let alone accurate.\nX-Plane is just far simpler to work with when you don't have a lot of information...\nWhether that's worth the downsides of X-Plane (especially the consequences of switching if you already have a heavy investment in FSX), I don't know.\nBut it's worth keeping in mind if you are particularly fond of amateur aircraft design.\n(It's even plausible to create fictional designs in x-plane for which no real-world data could ever exist in theory, and still get a good idea of how such a design likely would fly if it did exist.)\nAs for FSX potentially having better flight models in some cases? Maybe. But this is likely going to be the flight models of expensive add-on aircraft models that were made with the help of the manufacturer and pilots qualified to fly the real aircraft.\nThat's not going to help you any if you don't have access to those kinds of resources.\nA hand-tuned model matched to exact real-world data may well work better than a physics based model if you have good source data.\nBut if your source data is lousy (as it is for most of us unfortunately), then the physics based model will be much more reliable most of the time...\n\nA:\n\nDecent aerodynamic (wind tunnel) data is available courtesy of NASA / NTRS.\nWindtunnel derived aerodynamic data sources is where I have collected together detailed data for the B747, F-14 and F-15.\nB747 Aerodynamic data\n\nNASA CR-1756 The Simulation of a Large Jet Transport Aircraft Volume I: Mathematical Model, C.

{"text": "Dietary sodium chloride intake independently predicts the degree of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in healthy humans consuming a net acid-producing diet.\nWe previously demonstrated that typical American net acid-producing diets predict a low-grade metabolic acidosis of severity proportional to the diet net acid load as indexed by the steady-state renal net acid excretion rate (NAE). We now investigate whether a sodium (Na) chloride (Cl) containing diet likewise associates with a low-grade metabolic acidosis of severity proportional to the sodium chloride content of the diet as indexed by the steady-state Na and Cl excretion rates. In the steady-state preintervention periods of our previously reported studies comprising 77 healthy subjects, we averaged in each subject three to six values of blood hydrogen ion concentration ([H]b), plasma bicarbonate concentration ([HCO(3)(-)]p), the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco(2)), the urinary excretion rates of Na, Cl, NAE, and renal function as measured by creatinine clearance (CrCl), and performed multivariate analyses. Dietary Cl strongly correlated positively with dietary Na (P < 0.001) and was an independent negative predictor of [HCO(3)(-)]p after adjustment for diet net acid load, Pco(2) and CrCl, and positive and negative predictors, respectively, of [H]b and [HCO(3)(-)]p after adjustment for diet acid load and Pco(2). These data provide the first evidence that, in healthy humans, the diet loads of NaCl and net acid independently predict systemic acid-base status, with increasing degrees of low-grade hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis as the loads increase.

{"text": "1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to particularly an optical coherence tomography apparatus including an interference optical system which is used in the medical field, an optical coherence tomography method, an ophthalmic apparatus, a method of controlling the ophthalmic apparatus, and a storage medium.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nCurrently, various types of ophthalmic apparatuses using optical devices are used. Such apparatuses include, for example, an anterior ocular segment imaging apparatus, a fundus camera, and a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO). Among them all, an optical coherence tomography (OCT) apparatus (to be referred to as an \u201cOCT apparatus\u201d hereinafter) is an apparatus capable of obtaining a high-resolution tomogram of an object to be examined. This OCT apparatus has been becoming an indispensable apparatus for dedicated retinal outpatient clinics.\nFor example, the OCT apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-325849 uses low-coherent light as a light source. Light from the light source is split into measurement light and reference light through a splitting optical path such as a beam splitter. Measurement light is light to irradiate an object to be examined such as the eye through a measurement light path. Return light of this light is guided to a detection position through a detection light path. Note that return light is reflected light or scattered light containing information associated with an interface relative to the irradiation direction of light on the object. On the other hand, reference light is light to be guided to the detection position through a reference light path by being reflected by a reference mirror or the like. It is possible to obtain a tomogram of an object to be examined by causing interference between this return light and reference light, collectively acquiring wavelength spectra by using a spectrometer or the like, and performing Fourier transform of the acquired spectra. An OCT apparatus which collectively measures wavelength spectra is generally called a spectral domain OCT apparatus (SD-OCT apparatus).\nIn an SD-OCT apparatus, a measurement depth Lmax is represented, as an optical distance Lmax, by a pixel count N of the image sensor of a spectrometer and a spectrum width \u0394K of the frequency detected by the spectrometer according to equation (1). Note that the spectrum width \u0394K is represented by a maximum wavelength \u03bbmax and a minimum wavelength \u03bbmin. The pixel count N is often an even number, and is generally the factorial of 2, that is 1024 or 2048.\n                                                                                          L                  max                                =                                  \u00b1                                      N                                          4                      \u2062                                                                                          \u2062                      \u0394                      \u2062                                                                                          \u2062                      K                                                                                                                                                                \u0394                  \u2062                                                                          \u2062                  K                                =                                                      1                                          \u03bb                      min                                                        -                                      1                                          \u03bb                      max                                                                                                          }                            (        1        )            \nIf, for example, a central wavelength of 840 nm, a band of 50 nm, and a pixel count of 1024 are set, \u03bbmax=840+50/2=840+25=865 nm, \u03bbmin=840\u221250/2=840\u221225=815 nm, and N=1024. In this case, optical distance Lmax=3.6 mm. That is, it is possible to perform measurement up to about 3.6 mm on the plus side relative to the coherence gate. The coherence gate is the point at which a reference light path coincides with an optical distance in a measurement light path. When a desired region (a distance in the depth direction) is sufficiently smaller than 3.6 mm (for example, 1 mm or less), the measurement depth can be reduced by decreasing the pixel count of the spectrometer. Decreasing the pixel count is important in order to speed up processing and reduce the data amount. This is because, when measuring a three-dimensional image of the retina, it takes much measurement time and produces a large amount of data. When an object to be examined is a moving object like the eye, in particular, it is required to further shorten the measurement time.\nOn the other hand, changing the pixel count of a spectrometer is equivalent to changing the resolution of the spectrometer. A problem in this case will be described with reference to FIG. 1. FIG. 1 is a graph obtained by plotting, for each spectrometer resolution, the light intensity measurement results obtained when the position of the coherence gate is moved while a mirror is located at the position of an object to be examined. The ordinate corresponds to the light intensity, and the abscissa to the distance. With an increase in distance from the coherence gate, light intensity attenuation called Roll-Off occurs. The degree of attenuation of a light intensity Int mainly depends on the resolution of a spectrometer and the pixel count of an image sensor. Letting x be a distance variable and a be a coefficient proportional to the resolution of the spectrometer, the degree of attenuation is proportional to a sinc function given by\n                    Int        \u221d                              sin            \u2062                                                  \u2062            2            \u2062                                                  \u2062            \u03c0            \u2062                                                  \u2062            x            \u2062                                                  \u2062            \u03b1                                \u03c0            \u2062                                                  \u2062            x                                              (        2        )            \nAs is obvious from FIG. 1, as a value indicating a resolution increases (from 0.1 nm to 0.2 nm, 0.5 nm, and 1.0 nm), the cycle in which plotted points approach zero is shortened. As described above, images formed from spectrum data from spectrometers having different resolutions differ in light intensity in the depth direction. Differences in light intensity are differences in image contrast. This makes images in the same region look different. That is, with spectrometers having different resolutions, obtained images look different.\nIn consideration of the above problems, the present invention provides a technique of correcting the contrast differences between images which are caused when wavelength resolutions differ (spectrometers differ in resolution in the case of an SD-OCT) in an FD-OCT apparatus such as an SD-OCT apparatus.", "meta": {"pile_set_name": "USPTO Backgrounds"}}
